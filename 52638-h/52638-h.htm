Book</span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first address"><span class="sc">Dear
Schoolmate</span>:</p>
<p class="par">This new story in our series is about a people whose
name you heard often during the Great War; perhaps you even sent some
of your own pennies across the ocean to help them; for no one, not
gallant little Belgium itself, suffered more in the war than did the
Armenians. We sometimes think of them as the Belgians of the East, for
their resistance delayed the advance of Turkish battalions, just as
Belgium&rsquo;s brave stand prevented the first onrush of the Germans;
and the Turkish revenge has been more horrible than the German.</p>
<p class="par">The bulletins of the Near East Relief Committee, which
raised money for food and clothing and medicine and helpers in Western
Asia, tell us how the Turks tried to annihilate the Armenians, and how,
among <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e586" href="#xd21e586" name=
"xd21e586">x</a>]</span>the four million Armenians, Syrians, Jews,
Greeks, and Persians who survived, four hundred thousand were orphans.
In those first four months after the armistice, they were still dying
every day, by hundreds, of starvation and disease, they were homeless
and naked. Miss B. S. Papazian, an Armenian, has written a little book
about her people, &ldquo;The Tragedy of Armenia,&rdquo; in which she
says: &ldquo;The Armenians of Turkey to the number of about a million,
old and young, rich and poor, and of both sexes, had been collectively
drowned, burned, bayoneted, starved, bastinadoed, or otherwise tortured
to death, or else deported on foot, penniless and without food, to the
burning Arabian deserts.&rdquo; The whole story of their sufferings is
too terrible for children to read; yet, American children are not
willing to shut their eyes and ears to the sorrows of their brothers
and sisters, whether in France or Belgium, or close at home in our
American city slums, or far over seas in Asia Minor. I wonder how many
boys and girls who read this letter, adopted a French orphan, or gave a
little refugee a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e588" href=
"#xd21e588" name="xd21e588">xi</a>]</span>merry Christmas? And how many
had a share in feeding and clothing and educating some little forlorn
Armenian child?</p>
<p class="par">But this story of Archag, and his life at the missionary
school, is not in our Schoolmate Series merely because Armenians are a
persecuted people whom American children ought to love and to succor;
it is here also because there are a good many Armenians in America, and
more are coming, whose children will be American citizens in another
twenty years. The Armenians, like our own Puritan forefathers, came
here to escape religious persecution; so those of us who happen to be
descended from the early settlers in New England ought to have a strong
fellow-feeling for this other race of Christians who have suffered for
the sake of their religion and have hoped to find religious freedom
here with us.</p>
<p class="par">The Armenian Church, for which Armenians suffer
martyrdom in our enlightened twentieth century, is one of the most
ancient of the Churches of Christendom. Its founder was St. Gregory,
called the Illuminator, who received a heavenly vision and built a
little <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e594" href="#xd21e594" name=
"xd21e594">xii</a>]</span>chapel, in A. D. 303, on the spot on which
the vision came to him. It was this Gregory who converted King
Tiridates of Armenia to Christianity, and it was King Tiridates who
proclaimed Christianity the State religion of Armenia, some years
before the Emperor Constantine made it the state religion of Rome. The
Armenian Church is a democratic church, for the clergy in the villages
are appointed and paid by their own congregations, and often in poor
places the priest and his wife work in the fields with the peasants.
The Armenian&rsquo;s Church is the true home of his spirit. He has no
country of his own, for the region which we think of as Armenia was,
before the Great War, divided among three nations, Russia, Turkey, and
Persia, and arbitrarily ruled by them. The Armenians were a subject
people; but in their religion they were free, and they have endured
torture and death for the sake of this dear freedom.</p>
<p class="par">According to one of their own writers, Aram Raffi, the
name &ldquo;Armenia&rdquo; first appears in the fifth century before
Christ, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e598" href="#xd21e598"
name="xd21e598">xiii</a>]</span>the Armenians themselves have a name of
their own, which they like. They call themselves &ldquo;Hai,&rdquo; and
their country &ldquo;Hayastan,&rdquo; because they have a tradition
that they are descended from &ldquo;Haik,&rdquo; the son of Torgom,
great-grandson of Japheth, Noah&rsquo;s son. If you will look at your
map of Asia Minor, you will find that Mount Ararat, on which
Noah&rsquo;s Ark rested after the flood went down, is at the meeting
place of the three divisions of Armenia, the Russian division, the
Persian, and the Turkish; and it is not strange that with this
beautiful snow mountain soaring over their enslaved country, the
Armenians should trace their ancestry back so directly to Noah.</p>
<p class="par">It was during the latter part of the last century that
the Turkish Government set the Kurds on to massacre the Armenians. The
massacres of 1895&ndash;96, the massacre at Van in 1908, and those at
Adana and in Cilicia, in 1909, were all carried out by the consent of
the Turkish authorities. And because of these persecutions the
Armenians began to leave Asia Minor for America. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e602" href="#xd21e602" name=
"xd21e602">xiv</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Kurds, who committed the atrocities under the
instigation of the Turks, are a semi-nomad race, living part of the
year in tents; a picturesque, wild, ungovernable people, practicing a
sort of highway robbery as a trade, and a sort of Mohammedanism as a
religion. The Armenians, on the other hand, are farmers and merchants,
thrifty, intelligent, peaceful, eager for education, and, as you have
read, devoted Christians. It is not strange that two peoples so
different in habits and temperament should find it difficult to live
together, as neighbors; and the Turks, who are jealous of the
intelligence and industry and ability of the Armenians, and hate them
also for their Christianity, have not scrupled to stir up the Kurds
against them. What is still worse, they have compelled the Armenians to
live unarmed among their armed and fierce Kurdish enemies. We sometimes
hear the Armenians called cowardly, but if we had to live unarmed among
a hostile race who carried good modern rifles, we, too, might be called
cowards.</p>
<p class="par">No; we need not think of Armenians simply <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e607" href="#xd21e607" name=
"xd21e607">xv</a>]</span>as a down-trodden and feeble folk, who have
run away helplessly from danger, and to whom Americans must be
compassionate and charitable. They have something to give us, as well.
Their diligence is a good gift; they work hard, and they are
intelligent in their work. Their faithfulness to God is the best of
gifts. And they have a great love of education. This gift, if there
were no other, would win for them a place in the Schoolmate Series. In
a book called &ldquo;Travel and Politics in Armenia,&rdquo; by Noel and
Harold Buxton, published in 1914, which you may like to read some day,
we get a vivid idea of the love of the Armenians for their schools. The
authors say:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is a remarkable contrast between the
villages of Armenians and the villages of Kurds. We had traveled for
days in a Kurdish district, a waste of bare, sandy hills, with never a
tree or any sign of cultivation. Our halting-place for lunch proved to
be an Armenian village, and luscious melons were put before us, which
the arid soil produces in abundance as soon as a little <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e611" href="#xd21e611" name=
"xd21e611">xvi</a>]</span>irrigation is applied to it. While we sat in
the <i>Khan</i> (inn), the local schoolmaster appeared&mdash;a wonder
still more remarkable than the melons, for whoever heard of a school in
a Kurdish village? We seemed to be suddenly transported to a center of
civilization. This educational activity is beyond all praise. Here was
a man of some ability, prepared to live a lonely life in an isolated
village, for the sake of his nation and the younger
generation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">They go on to tell us of the school system, which is
voluntary and without Government aid. There is&mdash;or perhaps since
the War, one should say was&mdash;a National Committee for Education
which sat at Constantinople; the teachers were paid by the Committee,
and there were School inspectors for each district, in Turkish Armenia.
Pupils who could afford it paid for their schooling, but those who were
poor were not kept out by their poverty. Does not this sound very
modern, and American, and democratic? Surely, these are people who will
make good Americans. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e619" href=
"#xd21e619" name="xd21e619">xvii</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">And going to school in Armenia was an exciting
adventure, before the War. Listen to the story which the Buxtons tell
of a Secondary Boys&rsquo; School founded more than fifty years ago at
Varag, by an Armenian Bishop, a pioneer in modern education in
Armenia:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;At the time of the massacres (1909) masters and
boys had to fly to the mountains, and while they were absent, the
buildings were completely destroyed by fire. Nevertheless, an entire
reconstruction was undertaken. The Church, which happily was not
destroyed, occupies one side of the courtyard and the new buildings
occupy the other three; a second courtyard is now nearing completion
(1914). A second attempt was made less than three years ago to despoil
this institution. The attacking party, about a hundred strong, was
repelled by five Armenian revolutionaries, aided no doubt by the
&lsquo;young blood&rsquo; of the college. Now (1914) there are seventy
boys and seven teachers, all laymen. The system is pre-eminently
practical. The pupils are destined for teaching, and since it is
considered part of a village schoolmaster&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e624" href="#xd21e624" name=
"xd21e624">xviii</a>]</span>duty in Armenia to be able to assist
peasants in agricultural matters, thorough instruction is given in
fruit, vegetable, and poultry culture, dairy work, and general
gardening. The school grounds form a delightful oasis of irrigated
lands in the midst of surrounding desert. The school printing press was
stolen by the Government and the compositor abducted; but a more modern
machine has taken its place. Every boy takes his share, out of school
hours, in carpentry and house-work. The court-yard forms a fine
play-ground, and here, having mentioned Boy Scouts, I found myself
surrounded by an ardent crowd, thirsting for scout lore, and begging to
be enrolled at once as &lsquo;tenderfeet.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">What may have been the fate of this boys&rsquo; school
at Varag, since 1914, I dread to imagine. As it was a native school,
there is no mention of it, so far as I know, in the reports of American
Missionary Schools. We can only hope that some of those seventy boys
and their seven masters still live, and will one day take heart to
build up the old school again. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e628"
href="#xd21e628" name="xd21e628">xix</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Besides the native schools, there are the schools and
colleges established in Asia Minor by American Missionaries, and to
these also the Armenians flock. The author of &ldquo;Archag&rdquo; has
laid some of the scenes of his story in one of these famous missionary
schools, the Central Turkey College at Aintab, and has given us a
lively picture of the ardent young Armenians at their games and their
studies. Ever since &ldquo;Tom Brown at Rugby,&rdquo; school stories
have been the fashion, and it is reassuring to see how curiously akin
schoolboys are, all the world over, whether they be English lads at
Rugby, or Oriental youngsters at Aintab. Beneath their fezzes and
zoubouns, our Armenian hero and his friends are genuine boys at heart,
with a boy&rsquo;s sense of honor and love of good sport. The picture
of the school, too, is one for Americans to be proud of, with its
devoted teachers, its high intellectual standards, and its Christian
atmosphere. And its record during the War has been very fine. In the
Report of the American Board of Missions, 1918, I read that the four
missionaries who were able to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e631"
href="#xd21e631" name="xd21e631">xx</a>]</span>stay there &ldquo;have
all been carrying a heavy burden for, unlike many of our stations to
the north which were practically depopulated, Aintab has had an
ever-increasing number of refugees to care for. At times the attitude
of the local officials was distinctly hostile and the danger of further
massacre was great, but the opportune arrival of a British force on
December 15, 1918, saved the day and already there are signs of
recovery. Christian services are being attended by great crowds. The
Mission paper, Rahnuma, is being published by the College press, and
has practically become the official organ of the British Commander.
Schools will doubtless open soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But if schools and schoolboys are much alike, the world
over, vacations in Armenia are very different from American holidays.
No boys&rsquo; camps for Archag and his friends! Their adventures are
much more thrilling than your summer hikes and canoeings. There are no
patriot-outlaws in our mountains. But I must stop, or I shall be
telling you Archag&rsquo;s story, and that would not be fair. Only
this, let me say: our author, like <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e635" href="#xd21e635" name="xd21e635">xxi</a>]</span>all good
story-tellers, uses his imagination to make his story come alive; he
embroiders, as the French say, upon his facts; but if you will read in
the &ldquo;New York Evening Post,&rdquo; for Saturday, November 29,
1919, the account of Antranik, the Armenian patriot who came to this
country to ask help for his countrymen, you will find that fiction is
no more romantic than fact, in Asia Minor; and you will find
Antranik,&mdash;this very same hero, I think,&mdash;mentioned in our
story.</p>
<p class="par">Read the story, dear Schoolmate, and make friends with
these Armenian boys, who suffer so steadfastly for their country and
their God.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The boys had just finished a grammar lesson, and
as a reward for paying attention their master was reading them a bit of
history. Jousif hodja (schoolmaster) was a tall young man of twenty,
very slight, and frail in appearance, with dreamy black eyes. Perfect
silence reigned in the smoky old schoolroom while he read in a strong,
clear voice:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The day of battle had come at last!<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e665src" href="#xd21e665" name="xd21e665src">1</a>
Our men, commanded by Vartan the Mamigonian, had pitched their tents
that night on the plain of Avara&#299;r. The snowy peak of Ararat was
just becoming visible in the early light of dawn, when a sentinel burst
into Vartan&rsquo;s tent, crying: &lsquo;The Persians! The Persians!
they are coming!&rsquo; The chief went out from his tent and climbed a
hill around which we had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2"
name="pb2">2</a>]</span>made our camp. His piercing eye quickly
distinguished a black mass moving slowly, like surging waves, along the
Tabriz road. From time to time the silence of the plain was broken by a
dull threatening sound like the distant rumbling of thunder.... Vartan
was fighting in the thick of the fray; he seemed all unconscious of his
wounds and of the blood streaming from them; in despair he saw his
soldiers, overpowered by numbers, fast giving way. The ground was
strewn with the dead bodies of Armenians; the cries of the wounded were
drowned by the yells of the Persians. Vartan, with several brave
followers, had made his way almost up to Khan Mustapha, general of the
hostile forces, when a Kurd rushed upon him and dealt him a violent
blow with his scimitar, striking the back of his neck. Stunned by the
shock, the Mamigonian sank to earth, and was immediately surrounded by
a dozen devils; one cut off his legs, another, leaning over him with a
grimace, thrust his cutlass into the breast of the ill-starred
hero&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want him to die,&rdquo; sobbed
a boy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>of twelve. &ldquo;Oh, master, why did God let
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Some of the older boys began to laugh, but Jousif hodja
sternly silenced them, and going to the child, said to him:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come, Archag, quiet yourself; envy our Vartan, if
you will, admire him, but don&rsquo;t give him pity. His martyr&rsquo;s
death has sustained and fortified thousands of Armenians; even to-day,
after so many centuries of oppression and sorrow, to whom should we
lift our eyes if not to our national hero? We all love him, and in the
hour of danger we shall fight and die as worthy sons of
Vartan.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At these words the child gradually became quiet, dried
his tears and said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I want to follow his example.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The master stroked Archag&rsquo;s black curls; then, the
bell having already rung, he dismissed his pupils with the benediction.
In the twinkling of an eye the boys had put on their pretty red
slippers, strapped up their books, and were running through the streets
of Van, shouting, and chattering like a flock of sparrows. Archag was
among the first to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>scamper out; he ran like a shot as far as the
Cathedral, then turning at the back of the Bishop&rsquo;s house, he
followed a lane which led to the shore of the lake.</p>
<p class="par">His parents lived outside the city in one of those
flat-roofed dwellings so common in Asia Minor. His father owned a great
deal of livestock, herds of sheep and goats, as well as droves of
horses and camels; Archag breathed a sigh of content as he caught sight
of his father&rsquo;s house at a turn of the road. A young girl of
sixteen was coming to meet him; it was his sister Nizam, who made a
great pet of him. He threw his arms about her neck, and asked in a
wheedling tone:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tell me, have you been making something good for
my supper?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fie! you greedy boy,&rdquo; replied the young
girl. &ldquo;You think of nothing but eating. Tell me instead what you
did at school to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">At these words a shadow came over the child&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! Nizam, to-day is Vartan&rsquo;s Day, so

Don&rsquo;t you think our hero must have been like Jousif
hodja?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Nizam blushed at the name of the schoolmaster; for, to
tell the truth, the two young people were secretly in love.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now Archag, stop; what are you talking about?
Come along to supper. Mamma has been making tomato pilaaf for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pilaaf!<a class="noteref" id="xd21e711src" href=
"#xd21e711" name="xd21e711src">2</a> how jolly!&rdquo; and Archag ran
gayly toward the house. He burst into the kitchen like a gust of wind,
went to his father, Boghos<a class="noteref" id="xd21e714src" href=
"#xd21e714" name="xd21e714src">3</a> Effendi, and kissed his hand,
threw his books into a corner, took off his slippers,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e717src" href="#xd21e717" name="xd21e717src">4</a> and then sat
down on the floor between his mother and his little brother Levon.</p>
<p class="par">At Van, as in other remote towns in Asia Minor, chairs
and tables were still objects of luxury, and were rarely seen. People
just sat down on the floor.</p>
<p class="par">Boghos Effendi was a tall man about forty years of age.
Like his sons, he wore the zouboun, a long robe with a flannel girdle,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>opening over white cotton trousers; on his head he
wore a turban of yellow silk. His wife, Hanna badgi,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e726src" href="#xd21e726" name="xd21e726src">5</a> the mother
of our little friends, wore a brown silk dress made in European
fashion. Her hair hung down over her shoulders in two long black
braids. We have already made the acquaintance of pretty Nizam and
Levon. Two menservants, Bedros and Krikor,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e729src" href="#xd21e729" name="xd21e729src">6</a> and an old
serving woman named Gulenia, completed the family circle.</p>
<p class="par">Seated around an earthenware tray,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e735src" href="#xd21e735" name="xd21e735src">7</a> each one, armed
with a large spoon, dipped at will into a dish of pilaaf. On their
knees they had, each one, a large piece of bread piled with olives, but
this bread was quite different from ours; it was thin and flat, rather
like a soft pancake than bread. For ten minutes no sound was heard but
the crunching of jaws and the clatter of spoons (sounds which I would
by no means advise my readers to imitate); then, before standing up,
each rinsed the mouth and fingers again in a bowl of water.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">After supper, Archag and Levon ran off <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>together to
the stable to say good-night to their favorite little goat. Because of
the terrible cold which prevails in Asia Minor during several months of
the year, the stables are built under the ground; in this way they have
the advantage of being warm in winter and very cool in summer. Boghos
Effendi had a stable for the horses, one shed for the sheep and another
for the goats. Our two children had brought a handful of salt from the
kitchen, and the pretty Belette seemed to consider it a treat. Levon
amused himself by pulling the long silky hairs of the little animal, a
magnificent Angora goat. They would no doubt have stayed all night with
their horned friends if their mamma had not called them in to go to
bed. And even when called they did not obey very promptly; it was so
delightful in the stable.</p>
<p class="par">When they got back to the house they took a large
mattress and a thick wadded coverlet and spread them on the floor. In
one corner of the room there stood a little altar with a picture of
Saint Gregory the Illuminator,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e751src" href=
"#xd21e751" name="xd21e751src">8</a> dimly lighted by a night lamp. The
two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>children knelt down before the picture of their
patron saint to say their prayers. Then they took off their zoubouns
and stockings, rolled themselves up in a quilt, and were soon fast
asleep in spite of the hardness of their bed. The people of the Orient
are not accustomed to iron and wooden beds like ours.</p>
<p class="par">After supper Nizam had gone, as was her habit, to sit on
a great rock high above the house. At her feet was spread the lake,
with its marvelous frame of high mountains whose snow-crowned peaks,
now flushing red in the rays of the setting sun, seemed to be in the
heart of a vast fire. But the young Armenian girl had no eyes for the
beauty of the landscape; she was thinking of her mother whose delicate
health caused her great anxiety.</p>
<p class="par">Twilight falls rapidly in the Orient, and now the
jackals were yelping, and the dogs were howling in reply, and the moon,
a pale yellow crescent, was reflected in the dark waters of the lake.
Aroused from her reverie by the growing darkness, Nizam hurried back to
the house, where her parents were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11"
href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>waiting for her that they might
close the doors. Orientals go to bed soon after the sun, and before
long perfect stillness reigned in the solitary house. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2 class="main">AN INTERESTING JOURNEY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Fine weather had followed the April showers, and
as was his custom, Boghos Effendi was making preparations for a visit
to his farm at the foot of Mount Ararat,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e770src" href="#xd21e770" name="xd21e770src">1</a> on the Persian
frontier. This time, Archag was to go with his father, and the little
boy was beside himself with joy. He was to be absent several months,
galloping about all day on his pretty Mustang; and the Highland Farm
with its great herds of horses and flocks of sheep seemed to his
imagination an earthly Paradise indeed. Every morning when he woke up
his first question was: &ldquo;O, papa, are we going to-morrow?&rdquo;
He talked of nothing but this famous journey, and dreamed of it at
night. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At last the longed-for day arrived. It was still dark
when Hanna badgi went to wake Archag. She gave him a little shake:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Get up quickly, my son; your father is saddling
the horses already.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the twinkling of an eye the child was on his feet; he
ran to the courtyard to wash himself in cold water, then came back to
eat his breakfast. A bowl of goats&rsquo; milk, still warm, two pieces
of flat bread, and some cucumbers which Nizam had gathered the evening
before, were waiting for him in the kitchen. He ate heartily. His
mother&rsquo;s face was sad, as she sat watching him, and from time to
time she stealthily wiped away a tear. Her boy was leaving her for the
first time, and her heart sank as she thought of the dangers of the
journey. The Persian frontier was infested by bands of Kurds, living by
rapine and plunder, and as there was no mail service between Van and
the villages of Ararat, she would be without news of her dear ones, and
under a constant strain of anxiety.</p>
<p class="par">The moment for departure had arrived. Two zaptiehs
(police-officers) were to accompany <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>Boghos Effendi; indeed the only
safe way to travel in Asia Minor is with an escort of police; travelers
are thus under the protection of the Government, and the brigands will
not venture to attack them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ha&#299;d&eacute;, Archag, make haste,&rdquo;
called his father, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t wait for you any
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The women and little Levon came out to bid the travelers
a last <span class="corr" id="xd21e788" title=
"Source: goodby">good-by</span>. Archag cried as he embraced them, and
his mother put around his neck a medal, blessed by the Catholicos of
Echmiadzin,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e791src" href="#xd21e791" name=
"xd21e791src">2</a> as a protection against all danger. &ldquo;May our
holy Virgin guard you, my dearest boy,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to ask her that every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Mustang, Archag&rsquo;s handsome Tartar stallion, was
getting impatient, so his master leaped lightly on his back. The
horses, exhilarated by the fresh morning air, broke into a gallop;
Boghos Effendi and his son waved their handkerchiefs; one more last
look, then the house disappeared behind a clump of trees.</p>
<p class="par">The sun had just risen, and its first rays were gilding
the blue waters of the lake. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>After following the shore for two
hours, our travelers began to ascend toward the higher ranges of
mountains. Archag was leaving Van for the first time, and his eyes were
charmed by the beauty of the landscape. At this season the vegetation
was wonderfully luxuriant; the horses now trod on carpets of hyacinths
and wild tulips, or again, they pressed their way between hedges of
yellow eglantine. Great blue-green butterflies chased each other,
flitting from flower to flower. Presently the travelers entered an
immense tract of pine forest, and the horses neighed with content as
they sniffed the good resinous odors. Occasionally, their way was
impeded by a stream, swollen to a torrent by the snows of spring. The
water leaped over huge bowlders, sweeping along in its mad course the
trunks of ancient pines weary of battling against the elements. At this
time of year it was often difficult to find a ford, and when his horse
had bravely gone breast-deep into the stream, Archag, confused by the
deafening noise of the water, would be seized with dizziness, close his
eyes and cling to his Mustang. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16"
href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>But what joy to arrive safe and
sound on the other side! He would dry himself in the sun, and then go
on his way. Toward evening, they observed, far away to the north, an
isolated cone of purest white, rising above the dark mountains which
loomed up all around, and glistening in the sunlight.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ararat!&rdquo; cried Boghos Effendi, pointing it
out to his companions.</p>
<p class="par">Ararat! What memories the name awakened in
Archag&rsquo;s mind! He gazed with awe at this storied mountain, which
was said to have been the northern boundary of the earthly Paradise,
and the resting-place of Noah&rsquo;s Ark. Presently it vanished in the
clouds, and the little boy had a fancy that now, after having bounded
the Garden of Eden, it was about to become part of the heavenly
Paradise.</p>
<p class="par">Soon after this, they arrived at a khan (a sort of inn),
and on entering the courtyard they found the place in a state of great
excitement. The harem of the kaimakan (governor) of Erzeroum had just
arrived, and the ladies, veiled in black from head to foot, were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>hurrying out of their carriages, and gliding into
the house like shadows. Eunuchs followed carrying their baggage, and
the sight of these supercilious-looking black men made Archag draw
closer to his father. At the farther end of the courtyard there were
merchants engaged in unloading their camels; they stacked against the
wall great bales of rugs, woven in far-away Kurdistan, which they were
taking to Trebizond. From there the Kurd rugs would go to Europe and
find their places in the homes of rich people in Paris or London.</p>
<p class="par">In front of the house some Gregorian priests, returning
from a pilgrimage to Echmiadzin, were drinking coffee and smoking
narguilehs (water-pipes). They were sitting on the ground around a
mangal,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e813src" href="#xd21e813" name=
"xd21e813src">3</a> for in Armenia the nights are still very cold in
the month of May. Boghos Effendi approached them to kiss their hands,
as a mark of respect due to hadjis (pilgrims), whereupon the priests
received him in a friendly way, and made room for him by their
side.</p>
<p class="par">Night had fallen, a dark night, with no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>moon.
The other travelers drew near to the pleasant warmth of the mangal.
There they all were: the Armenian pilgrims, the Kurd merchants, the
Turkish pashas with their suite, traveling on official business, an old
Persian on his way to Angora, and the camel-drivers, with their
weather-stained faces, chewing balls of resin, without pause. Pretty
soon, an Arab, a native of Bagdad, began to tell a story worthy of a
place in &ldquo;The Arabian Nights.&rdquo; Except for his voice there
were no sounds but the bubbling of the narguilehs or the distant cry of
a hyena lying in wait for prey. Our friend Archag, sitting beside his
father, with his pretty red slippers placed in front of him, heard the
monotonous drone of the story-teller as if in a dream. The gurgling of
a camel roused him from his drowsiness for an instant, but he soon
relapsed into the blessed sleep of childhood. His father had to take
him up in his arms, and lay him as he was, all dressed, on the bed
which had been prepared for him.</p>
<p class="par">Boghos Effendi stayed several days at Bayazid, a
fortress on the Russian frontier, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>crowning a great rock; and here
Archag was much impressed by the Tartars, with their high boots, their
poniards at their side, and their tall Astrakhan caps. These men spent
their evenings in wild rides about the valley below the town,
flourishing their sabers above their heads, and uttering shrill cries
which re-echoed from the great rocks. But the boy was beginning to grow
impatient at the length of the journey, so he was very glad when his
father told him that they were to leave Bayazid the next morning, and
would arrive at their destination two days later.</p>
<p class="par">The country now was quite barren and uncultivated; from
time to time they would meet a Kurd shepherd, clad only in a
sheep-skin, who cast unfriendly glances at them. Everyday, at noon, the
travelers stopped near some spring to eat their luncheon; then, wearied
by the long hours in the saddle, they would stretch themselves out and
take a good nap, before proceeding on their journey.</p>
<p class="par">This hour of quiet was the hardest part of the day for
our friend Archag; he hated to sleep, and his father had strictly
forbidden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>him to roam about. The two zaptiehs used to snore
away with a good conscience, without compunction, and Krikor would
respond to them with a nasal grunt very much like a pig. Usually,
Archag amused himself by plucking a spear of grass and tickling the
sleepers under their noses; sometimes, to give variety to his
diversion, he would pinch the tips of their ears or pull their hair.
Then the men would swear in their sleep, turn over, or strike out into
the air with their fists, to the great amusement of the culprit.
Luckily for him, they never woke up, or they would have made him pay
well for his impudence.</p>
<p class="par">Now, on the second day after leaving Bayazid, Archag
found no amusement in his usual sport; he was bored, and began to throw
stones at the cones on the pine-trees. He seldom missed his aim, and
gave a shout of triumph whenever a cone fell to the ground. In the
midst of this sport a slight noise above his head made him look up, and
he saw a pretty brown squirrel perched on the branch of a tree. The
little creature looked at him in a mocking way, then sprang to another
tree, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>the boy followed him softly, forgetting all his
fine resolutions.</p>
<p class="par">Our two companions, Archag with his nose in the air, the
squirrel leaping from tree to tree, strayed farther and farther away
from the encampment, and when the child, weary of his pursuit,
concluded to retrace his steps, he saw that he was a long distance from
the place where he had left his father. He was starting to go back at
once, when he heard a low growling sound from behind a big rock, and
you may imagine his terror when he saw a great brown bear making its
way toward him. The child thought it was all over with him, but he did
not lose his head; he recalled a story he had once read, and lay down
on the ground, feigning death. His heart beat fast indeed, but the
bear, after turning him over with its paws, smelt him carefully, and
went on its way, heedless of the wanderer, and Archag got up and took
to his heels, running to throw himself into his father&rsquo;s arms.
Boghos Effendi turned pale on hearing of the danger into which his
child had run; but he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span>did not scold him, for he thought that he had
been punished enough.</p>
<p class="par">The rest of the journey was accomplished without
incident. All the shepherds came out to meet the travelers, and they
made a triumphal entry into the Highland Farm. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The next morning, Archag rose with the dawn. He
went down to the courtyard, drew a bucketful of cold water from the
well, and plunged his head in it, shivering. Then he went back to the
kitchen, and hastily ate his joghurt (a sort of curdled milk) which he
spread on bread. His breakfast was dispatched in less than five
minutes, and calling &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; to his father, he
rushed out of doors.</p>
<p class="par">The farm of Boghos Effendi was on a plateau three or
four kilometers in length, resting on the lower foothills of Ararat.
The house was low but spacious, and served as a dwelling for a dozen or
more shepherds. Great herds of horses and flocks of sheep grazed freely
in the fine pastures which extended as far as eye <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>could
see. The nights being very cold, the live-stock had to be brought in
every evening to the caves and cellars which served as stables.</p>
<p class="par">Archag was enchanted as he looked around. The sun had
just risen, and shed a rosy light on the glaciers of mighty Ararat. The
country on which it shone was wild and dreary, leading one to
conjecture that at some period a terrible cataclysm must have shaken it
to the very foundations. The plateau terminated at either end in a
steep precipice, at the base of which rushed a noisy stream; it was
sheltered on the north by a wall of impregnable rock; on the south the
wooded slopes descended gently to the valley. Archag had never seen
anything like it, and was greatly impressed. As he roamed about, here
and there, he discovered a little lake formed in the crater of an
extinct volcano. He clapped his hands as he caught sight of the emerald
waves, and jumping over the border of rocks, he plunged his hand in the
water. It was icy cold. He then amused himself with skipping stones,
but at the end of half an hour he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25"
href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>had become tired of this sport,
and resumed his journey of exploration. The sheep had gone toward the
house, for it was time for them to be milked. Appetite comes quickly on
the mountains, and Archag, having a strange feeling of emptiness in his
stomach, asked one of the shepherds to give him a glass of milk. He
drank it with relish, and then licked off the cream which had formed a
thick mustache on his lips.</p>
<p class="par">Next, he ran to look at the horses, for like all
Orientals, he had a passion for them. There were about two hundred
here; small animals with intelligent eyes and long tails which swept
the ground. One of them especially excited his admiration; it was a
five-year-old stallion, entirely black except for a white star on the
forehead. Archag went up to it, holding out a bit of sugar, which the
animal took with a distrustful air.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take care, Baron Archag!&rdquo; called a
shepherd, &ldquo;the very devil is in that beast. I mounted him this
morning, and he gave me a good shaking up, I can tell you! I left the
saddle on, so he might get used to it.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But Archag, not listening, had already jumped on the
horse&rsquo;s back. The creature gave a start on feeling this
unaccustomed burden, kicked, stood up on his hind legs, then, seeing
that nothing could rid him of his rider, darted off like an arrow
toward the valley. But Archag had been used to horses ever since he was
a baby, and the stallion did not succeed in throwing him by any of
these tricks. He sat up straight in the saddle, holding the reins
lightly. This mad ride was enchanting to him, and he had no sense of
danger. At length the horse&rsquo;s high spirit began to flag; he
stopped a moment to drink at a stream, then started up a steep slope.
After running half way round the valley, he returned to the pasture of
his own accord, and Archag soon caught sight of the Highland Farm. The
shepherds, well frightened by these pranks, came to meet him and praise
him for his courage. The little boy sprang to the ground, gently patted
his steed, and wiped off with his handkerchief the sweat that covered
him.</p>
<p class="par">After that, our friend took a ride on his new horse
every morning, and before long <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"
href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>claimed him as his own. A young
shepherd lad, called Jakoub, was his companion on these rides. Boghos
Effendi had not the time to go about with him, and he considered his
son still too much of a child to ride about alone over hill and dale.
The two boys would go off early in the morning, taking their dinner of
hard-boiled eggs, cheese, bread and fruit with them, and would not
return until evening. The country offered a great variety of
excursions; in two months the boys had roamed over all the valleys,
climbed all the hills in the vicinity, and explored the forests, still
almost virgin. With this sort of life, Archag&rsquo;s face grew brown,
his chest broadened, and his muscles hardened.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Where shall we go to-morrow?&rdquo; he asked his
new friend one evening.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;To the Kutshukd&eacute;r&eacute; (Little Valley),
and we will go in bathing in the lake.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yok yok, (no, no,)&rdquo; replied Archag,
&ldquo;we have been there four times already.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, then, let&rsquo;s go to the village of
Buldur.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t care anything about
that.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Archag was in a naughty mood; he kicked his heels
against the rock on which he was sitting.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We might go to the cave of Karad&eacute;r&eacute;
(Black Valley),&rdquo; said Jakoub, after a while, hesitating,
&ldquo;only&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Only what?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Only the neighborhood is infested by brigands,
and your father would never let us go there if he knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is it far from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Six hours on horseback; but the road is bad, and
hard to find.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Have you been there yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, last year with my dayeh (uncle). Just
imagine a hall underground, as high as a cathedral, all decorated with
festoons and lace of stone! I never saw anything so beautiful in all my
life, and I would just like to go there again like everything!&rdquo;
cried Jakoub, quite carried away by his enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the brigands do anything to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, a poor shepherd boy like me? They knew well
enough that I hadn&rsquo;t a penny. But you, you see, you&rsquo;re the
son of the rich Boghos <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29"
name="pb29">29</a>]</span>Effendi; it would be worth their while to put
themselves out for such good pickings.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pshaw, they wouldn&rsquo;t know who I am.
I&rsquo;ll put on old clothes, and any one would have to be pretty
sharp to recognize me. All right, then, that&rsquo;s settled for
to-morrow; come and wake me up to make sure. I&rsquo;ll get our lunch
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The thought of this adventurous ride had restored
Archag&rsquo;s good humor. He stood up, gave his comrade a slap on the
back, and ran away from him, calling out:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Catch me if you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was more nimble than Jakoub, and soon disappeared in
the farm-yard.</p>
<p class="par">At four the next morning, he awoke with a start at the
sound of a servant&rsquo;s rap on the door. In an instant he was on his
feet, and had rolled up his mattress and coverlets, and stuffed them
into a cupboard. His father was still in bed when Archag went into his
room to speak to him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pariluis hairick (Good morning, papa),&rdquo; he
said, kissing his father&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Jakoub <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>and I
are off for a ride. It&rsquo;s so hot we want to start
early.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Tschatkeretsick (Very well),&rdquo; replied
Boghos Effendi. &ldquo;Be careful, and don&rsquo;t be too late in
coming home this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">These last words were lost on Archag, who had already
left the room. Jakoub was waiting for him in the kitchen:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve saddled the horses; everything is
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good boy! Have you had any breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag offered his companion a bit of cheese, setting
his pretty teeth in his own portion as he did so.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;These poor sheep!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They
give us their milk and we eat their lambs. Men are really very
unkind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Jakoub stared at him in astonishment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bless my soul, I never thought of that, nor the
sheep, either, you may be sure; they are too stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Luckily for them; but they do suffer just
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>the same as we do, and you mustn&rsquo;t hit them
any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I promise not to, if that can give you any
pleasure; but we had better be off, instead of arguing about the
sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">A few minutes later the two boys were speeding along,
rocked by the motion of the galloping horses, which made good headway,
undaunted by the rough, stony road.</p>
<p class="par">After riding up the Karad&eacute;r&eacute; (Black
Valley) for about three hours, they had to climb a slope covered with
fallen rocks and d&eacute;bris. They followed a narrow trail which was
scarcely discernible, and Jakoub lost his way twice, so that they had
to retrace their steps. For several hours they did not meet a human
being, although from time to time they heard the growl of a bear in the
distance, or a troop of wild asses ran away from them in fright. Archag
was beginning to be afraid they would never find the cave, when his
companion gave a joyful shout:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Here we are all right, this time,&rdquo; and he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>pointed out a ravine sparsely overgrown with
shrubs.</p>
<p class="par">They sprang to the ground and tied their horses. Archag
looked all around.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You must be mistaken,&rdquo; he said at last,
&ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t a sign of any cave here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then Jakoub showed him an opening half hidden by the
bushes and so narrow that it seemed almost impossible that any one
could squeeze through it. Jakoub, however, had already disappeared with
the agility of a snake, and our friend attempted to follow him. But it
was no easy matter; the rocks held him as in a vise, and he was nearly
strangled. His feet dangled in space, he was in a critical situation,
there was no way to climb either up or down. Then, suddenly, he felt
himself being pulled from below, and the next minute he was at
Jakoub&rsquo;s side, very dizzy indeed. The two boys were at the top of
a sunken passage, which they followed valiantly, making their way down
with many a slip, until at last they came to the end. Here Jakoub
lighted his lantern, and they cried out together in wonder and
surprise. The chamber <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>to which they had found their way was so high
that they could scarcely make out the vaulted roof. Marvelous
stalactites gave the place a magic beauty; along the walls were ranged
thrones and seats wrought with artistic grace, which seemed to beckon
them to rest; at their feet crept stone monsters of repulsive form.
Archag wondered if he were really awake, or if he had been transported
in a dream to some subterranean palace of the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights.&rdquo; Behind a row of columns was an outlet leading to a
gallery, and the boys set out to explore this also, but when they had
taken perhaps a hundred steps, they were obliged to stoop down and
crawl along the ground, for the passage had become no more than a
narrow tunnel in the rock.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; cried Jakoub, who had taken the
lead.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Archag.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The tunnel had come to an abrupt end, and a black chasm
yawned before them. Jakoub inspected it with his lantern, and found
that it was a pit full of water. For a while they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>amused
themselves by throwing in stones to sound the depth and then retraced
their steps. At length they regained the entrance to the cave.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That was splendid!&rdquo; said Archag, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m glad enough to breathe fresh air again and get away from that
everlasting night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Their escapade had made them hungry, and they ate their
luncheon eagerly. Then they lay down in the shade of a rock and fell
fast asleep.</p>
<p class="par">Archag, who was not in the habit of taking a siesta, was
the first to wake, and he rubbed his eyes in bewilderment at sight of
two cross-looking men standing near him. He gave Jakoub a kick, and
pointed to them in silence.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, my little friends,&rdquo; said one of the
men, with a crafty look, &ldquo;waked up at last, have you? You have
had a good nap there, Machallah! Now you are going to follow us quietly
without any nonsense, or va&#299; sizi&rdquo; (the worse for
you),&rdquo; and the &ldquo;bravo&rdquo; touched the butt of his
pistol.</p>
<p class="par"></p>
<div class="figure xd21e980width" id="p035"><img src="images/p035.jpg"

<p class="figureHead">KURDS</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Both boys realized at once that they were in the power
of the brigands. Never in all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>their life had they seen persons of
such forbidding appearance: big rough fellows they were, with bristling
beards, noses like eagles&rsquo; beaks, and sharp teeth all ready to
bite, like the fangs of a wolf. They were clad in long cloaks, worked
with silver; at the belt of each shone the butt of a pistol and the
handle of a yatagan. By their speech the boys easily recognized them as
Kurds, the sworn enemies of their race. God alone knew what fate was in
store for them!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mount your horses and move on,&rdquo; said the
elder of the brigands.</p>
<p class="par">Our two friends obeyed promptly, and each bandit led a
horse by its bridle along the path, a dangerous one, which clung to the
side of a sheer precipice and overhung the deep gorge below. After
riding nearly an hour, they came to a valley confined between high
mountains. Here the bandits blindfolded the boys, and a quarter of an
hour later they bade them dismount. They were in a spacious cave,
lighted up by a number of pine torches, for the daylight scarcely
penetrated the place. A dozen brigands were sitting in a circle around
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>a wood fire, eating and drinking; the walls of the
cavern resounded with their loud shouts of laughter. When they saw the
two boys they invited them to share their repast, and our friends
obeyed with alacrity, for the ride had sharpened their appetite.</p>
<p class="par">Archag looked all around with curiosity; he was no
longer afraid, and since he had had something to eat, he found some
amusement in the adventure. He had concluded, reasonably enough, that
since the men had offered them food, they were not going to kill them.
The brigands plied him with questions, to which he replied quite
simply, and his remarks often provoked a smile from the company.
Jakoub, on the other hand did not open his mouth except to eat, and his
eyes were big with fear. He did not listen to what was said, while
Archag followed the bandits&rsquo; conversation with great interest.
One of them, a young fellow with a scarcely perceptible mustache, was
telling his latest exploit:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I had been at Bayazid two weeks, looking out in
vain for some stroke of luck; but one would have said that Mohammed had
forgotten <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>his faithful ones; I hadn&rsquo;t been able to
take a single purse; I was suffering from hunger and had to pull my
belt tighter every day. At last, one evening, I saw a richly dressed
man pass on his way to the hamam (bath). I followed him, and it went to
my heart to have to give up my last piastre for an entrance fee. But
once in, I went, as if by chance, and sat down beside him, and I
praised the beauty of his beard. &lsquo;Seven times happy,&rsquo; said
I to him, &lsquo;he upon whom Allah has bestowed a beard like thine, a
plain mark of wisdom.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The stout fellow bridled and thanked me with a
smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Thy servant,&rsquo; I continued, &lsquo;is
still very young; a scant half-dozen hairs chase each other over my
chin; but being as yet unable to pretend to wisdom, I always seek the
society of learned and erudite men, for their words are as sweet as
honey and as intoxicating as cerevisia.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;By talk like this I won the confidence of the
fool; and before long, by worming it out of him I had learned his
story. He was a rich <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40"
name="pb40">40</a>]</span>merchant from Bagdad, who had been up the
Tigris to sell a consignment of coffee and to buy Kurdistan rugs. He
had been successful in his business, and was planning to set out for
his native town the next morning. I passed myself off for the son of a
caravan master of Aleppo, reading law at Ispahan, and now returning
home for my vacation. In a short time we were the best friends in the
world. I ordered innumerable cups of coffee and portions of hasheesh,
for which I allowed him to pay. When we left the bath, my companion was
completely under the influence of the intoxicating drug; he
couldn&rsquo;t take a step without leaning heavily on my arm. I had
arranged my game in advance, and when we were in the lonely part of the
town behind the citadel, I attacked him and relieved him of his belt,
all lined with gold pieces. He was so stupefied by my behavior that he
couldn&rsquo;t say a word. Then, before leaving him, I cut his beard,
&lsquo;for,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;noble descendant of the prophet, your
hair will make me a magnificent false beard, and thanks to your
profound wisdom, your own will make speed to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>grow
again.&rsquo; A smart kick sent him rolling into a ditch, where I left
him to work off his hasheesh. I hadn&rsquo;t time to bother with him
any more; I hurried back to my inn, jumped astride my horse, and came
straight back here to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">During the narration of this tale, the boys, overcome
with drowsiness, had dropped off to sleep, and the brigands had laid
them on a bed of leaves, where they slept the whole night through
without waking.</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile, Boghos Effendi had been tormented by the most
painful anxiety. At six o&rsquo;clock, finding that the boys had not
yet returned, he supposed that they had been delayed. But when at eight
they had not come, he began to be seriously alarmed. He sent the
shepherds out in bands to scour the neighborhood; but they were unable
to bring him any tidings, and the poor father passed the night in
mortal fear. At four in the morning, he was about to institute a new
search, when he was told that a boy was waiting to speak to him. He
went out immediately, and found a Kurd shepherd lad in the courtyard,
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>handed him a letter. He broke the seal with a
trembling hand. There were but a few words to read:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first">&ldquo;Your son and his companion have been taken
prisoners by the brigands. Send one of your servants without escort to
the cave of Kara Dagh, bringing the sum of one hundred pounds and the
children will be set at liberty.</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Essad Chan.</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;P. S.&mdash;If the money is not there by five
o&rsquo;clock this evening, you will never see your son alive
again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Boghos Effendi put the letter in his pocket and looked
up to ask the messenger some questions, but the lad had already
disappeared. It was useless to go after him, and so the unhappy father
called his steward and two old shepherds to come and give him their
advice. They all, without hesitation, counseled him to send the money
as quickly as possible, for Essad Chan was the most dangerous brigand
in the country, and had both force and cunning at his command. Boghos
Effendi then gave his steward the hundred pounds, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>charged
him to make haste so that he might reach the cavern before noon.</p>
<p class="par">When the boys awoke, they were very much surprised to
find themselves in a cave. Little by little, they recalled the events
of the previous day, and began to wonder anxiously what the future had
in store for them. The brigands, however, gave them no cause for
complaint. A bountiful breakfast was offered them, and then one of the
bandits invited Archag to play chess with him. The boy accepted with
pleasure; he was a good player, but shrewd enough to let his opponent
win. Another brigand took up his tamboura (a sort of mandolin) and fell
to singing. In this way the morning passed pleasantly enough for the
two captives; they were very happy, however, when some one came to tell
them that they were free. They were blindfolded once more, so that they
might not be able to describe the exact situation of the cave, and the
brigands, on removing their bandages, made the boys swear on the
crucifix not to follow them, nor try to find their hiding-place.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>The two lads took the oath, only too happy to get
off so easily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Only,&rdquo; said Archag, &ldquo;I am very
thirsty, and I should very much like to have something to
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The brigands burst out laughing, and one of them offered
Archag his gourd, with a friendly slap on the shoulder. Archag thanked
him, and then the two boys put spurs to their horses and went off at
full gallop. When, after a time, they slackened their pace, Kara Dagh
was far behind them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If that wasn&rsquo;t a scrape!&rdquo; cried
Archag. &ldquo;Whatever will my father say?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Jakoub shrugged his shoulders in reply, and they rode on
in silence.</p>
<p class="par">When our friend caught sight of his father, who was
anxiously watching for them at the entrance to the farm, he jumped down
from his horse, gave the reins to Jakoub, and ran to meet him and to
ask forgiveness.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My son,&rdquo; replied Boghos Effendi,
&ldquo;your imprudence might have cost you your life. You know that
when I go on a journey I never take more money with me than is
absolutely <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>necessary. If I had not sold three horses the
other day to that Persian from Tabriz, I should not have been able to
pay for your ransom, and then you may be sure the robbers would have
listened to none of your cries or tears; they would have kept their
word and killed you. God has had compassion on us, and He has given you
a salutary lesson. Never forget what anxiety you have caused your
father to suffer, nor the money your folly has cost me, hard-earned
money on which I was depending for this winter&rsquo;s expenses; and
try to be more discreet in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag promised, and was in tears as he kissed his
father&rsquo;s hand. He no longer felt himself a hero, but realized
that he was only a little boy come home from a mad escapade. He never
thought of this adventure afterward without a blush of shame.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Boghos Effendi forbade his son to go away from the
farm again, and the days that followed were very long for our little
friend, so he was glad when his father told him that they would soon be
going back to Van. Winter sets in early on these high table-lands, and
Boghos Effendi wanted to get home before cold weather. The shepherds
were very sorry to see Archag go; his high spirits had brightened their
monotonous days, and they made him promise to come back another
summer.</p>
<p class="par">The journey home was accomplished without any remarkable
adventures, and at the end of three weeks Archag was once more in his
mother&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;How nice it is to be at home!&rdquo; he
kept saying, over and over again.</p>
<p class="par">A week after his arrival he resumed his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>lessons.
He had well-nigh forgotten them during his holidays, and had to work
hard and steadily to catch up with his schoolmates. During the long
winter evenings he never tired of talking about his journey, and of the
Highland Farm, and everything he had seen. Levon listened with mouth
wide open, in rapt admiration of his older brother.</p>
<p class="par">An important event now turned the current of the
boys&rsquo; thoughts into a new channel, and occupied all their spare
hours. Jousif hodja had asked Boghos Effendi for the hand of Nizam, and
the Feast of Saint Sylvester was set for the wedding-day. So from
November on, the house was like a bee-hive, for there was the trousseau
to be finished, and purchases had to be made, to say nothing of the
preparations for the wedding feast. As the days passed, the excitement
increased. Every afternoon the neighbors came to offer their help and
gratify their curiosity. They examined the presents, criticised them,
and expressed their opinions, to the great exasperation of old Gulenia,
who scolded them roundly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href=
"#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Archag and Levon wrote the invitations, and helped in
the kitchen whenever there were eggs to be beaten and dough to be
stirred.</p>
<p class="par">The morning of the wedding-day came at last. Nizam,
arrayed in rose-colored silk, sat in the middle of the reception room;
her head was covered with a veil held at the temples by large gold
sequins. She sat stiff and silent, for propriety forbade her to open
her mouth on this day even to reply to the congratulations of her
relatives and friends. Archag, always a tease, declared that she would
make up for it later. Her face was pale, and there were dark rings
around her eyes; she had been up since dawn and was still fasting, for
she was to make her Communion in church after hearing the nuptial Mass.
She cast envious glances at her guests, who were eating and drinking,
and apparently enjoying themselves very much.</p>
<p class="par">About eleven o&rsquo;clock, the firing of cannon
announced that it was time to start for church. Nizam rose, and her
mother drew the veil over her face; then two youths set her on a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span>white horse which was waiting for her in the
courtyard. The young bride of the Orient has to make a show of
resistance as an expression of sorrow at leaving her father and mother,
and the friends of the bridegroom must drag her out of the house by
force. The parents, for their part, bewail the departure of their
daughter.</p>
<p class="par">Nizam was fairly successful in feigning a sorrow which
she really did not feel at all, for she loved Jousif hodja. With one
hand she held the bridle of her horse, and with the other she pressed
to her bosom a mirror, a symbol of the purity which she was to bring to
her husband. All her friends followed, uttering cries of grief. The
bridegroom and his friends were awaiting Nizam&rsquo;s retinue in front
of the Cathedral. When they saw the company enter the square, they gave
shouts of welcome and fired pistols in token of their joy.</p>
<p class="par">Nizam knelt down beside Jousif while the choir boys sang
a charagan (hymn). The Bishop, vested in his chimere had ascended the
steps of the altar: he intoned the Mass, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>and asked the betrothed
if they desired to become husband and wife, and upon their assent, he
gave them the Host, and held the chalice for them to drink of the red
wine, the blood of Jesus Christ. Then, as they knelt together, he
blessed them with an ivory crucifix, slipped the wedding-ring over
their fingers, and thus united them for the sharing of the joys and
sorrows of life. Then Nizam and Jousif stood up, and more charagans
were sung, interspersed with the firing of guns and cannon.</p>
<p class="par">The religious ceremony over, the bridal pair and their
guests went to the house of Jousif hodja, where a great collation
awaited them. The plates were heaped with portions of turkey, goose,
woodcock and grouse; then came a course of pastry and Turkish sweets:
baklava<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1086src" href="#xd21e1086" name=

lokums<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1089src" href="#xd21e1089" name=
"xd21e1089src">2</a> melting in the mouth, preserved peaches and plums,
orangeade, cedrats, colored sugar-plums, and brown and white nougat.
Coffee was served in tiny silver cups, passed around by the servants;
some of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>the guests preferred sherbets (iced drinks)
flavored with rose, violet or vanilla.</p>
<p class="par">All were happy and gay: the bridal pair alone were not
expected to take part in the general merriment, but sat in formal
silence, enthroned at the head of the table.</p>
<p class="par">A white-haired bard sang this ancient ballad,
accompanying himself on the tamboura:</p>

Diocletian. Having taken a religious vow, she refused to become the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Three years and a half have elapsed since
Nizam&rsquo;s marriage. These years were marked by only one important
event in the family of Boghos Effendi: the birth of little Jersebeth,
the daughter of Nizam and Jousif hodja. Hanna badgi is still living,
but her delicate health causes great anxiety to the other members of
the family, who are in constant fear of losing her. Archag is now a lad
of sixteen, slight and strong, looking quite eighteen. Last year he
spent his holidays at the Highland Farm; this time his visit was not
spoiled by adventures such as we have related; he was a great help to
his father, and even took his place at the horse sales.</p>
<p class="par">He has completed the course in the school at Van, and
his father has decided to send him to the American College at Aintab.
Our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>friend has heard a great deal about it from his
older companions; he is fond of his studies, and delighted to be able
to go on with them, for he has little inclination for mercantile life,
although he has not yet chosen his vocation.</p>
<p class="par">Boghos Effendi had written to the president of the
college, and at last, after two long months of waiting and suspense,
the post-master one day gave Archag a letter bearing the Aintab
postmark.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1244src" href="#xd21e1244" name=
"xd21e1244src">1</a> Our friend made haste to carry it to his father.
The president, Dr. Mills, wrote that he would admit Archag to the
Sophomore class on payment of twelve Turkish pounds (fifty-five
dollars) for the year. The term was to begin on the twentieth of
September, and as it was already the twenty-fifth of August, there was
no time to be lost, for it was necessary to allow three or four weeks
for the journey. A caravan was leaving Van for Aleppo on the first of
September, passing through Marash and Aintab, and it was decided that
Archag should travel in the company of these merchants. It would have
been quite impossible for a boy of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>age to take such a
journey entirely alone. These last days, filled with a host of
preparations, passed all too quickly for our friend, who was feeling
sad at the thought of leaving home and family.</p>
<p class="par">The day before his departure he went with his father to
the serail to ask for a teskereh (passport). The kaimakan, engrossed in
reading his Stamboul newspaper, received them sullenly; but as Boghos
Effendi was one of the most influential members of the Armenian
community, he did not dare refuse the desired passport. He wrote down
Archag&rsquo;s name and age, his weight and height, the color of his
hair and eyes and even of the clothes he was to wear on the journey;
then he made a note of all the places through which the lad would have
to pass. Boghos Effendi willingly paid the two mejidiehs (about two
dollars) for the precious paper, for at this period the Armenians were
often refused passports and so were unable to travel at all; father and
son kissed the pasha&rsquo;s hand, as a sign of submission, and made
low bows as they withdrew. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Archag spent the rest of the day with his sister and
brother-in-law. Jousif hodja had studied at Aintab, and so was able to
give the boy some good advice:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Think yourself fortunate, my lad,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to have the privilege of working with such men as Professor
Pagratian and Professor Hagopian. Go to see Mrs. Spencer, the
doctor&rsquo;s wife, now and then; she loves our people, and her
example will stimulate you. And whatever any one may say to you, always
remember with joy and pride that you are an Armenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And our president!&rdquo; asked Archag.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dr. Mills is a man of high attainments, and the
college has made remarkable progress under his direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Nizam begged her brother to write often, to be a good
boy and go to church regularly. Archag embraced his sister and
brother-in-law with much feeling, and promised to do everything they
wished.</p>
<p class="par">His last meal at home was a sad one, for every one was
silent and pre-occupied. Archag went to bed early but he did not sleep
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>well; he kept waking up with a start, dreaming
that he was late. At daybreak old Gulenia came to call him and he
dressed quickly. He had hardly finished his breakfast when the tinkling
of camels&rsquo; bells was heard.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Archag Effendi, are you ready?&rdquo; called an
old Arab.</p>
<p class="par">The lad&rsquo;s horse was waiting in the courtyard.
Krikor had fastened our friend&rsquo;s boxes to the saddle, one on each
side, and spread a mattress and blankets over the horse&rsquo;s back.
Archag flung himself into the arms of his father and mother, then knelt
to receive their blessing. He gave his brother a hug, called out a last
good-by to the servants gathered in the courtyard, mounted his horse
and settled himself very comfortably on the seat that Krikor had
arranged. Again and again he looked back to wave his handkerchief,
tears streaming down his cheeks.</p>
<p class="par">His journey was long and difficult; the camels walked at
a pace so exasperatingly slow, that Archag, worn out with fatigue,
would fall asleep with his arms around his horse&rsquo;s neck. To avoid
the heat, the caravan <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"
name="pb59">59</a>]</span>would start at daybreak and travel till noon,
rest till three or four o&rsquo;clock and then go on several miles
farther. Each night was spent at an inn, where Archag could scarcely
sleep at all for the vermin. When he was just falling into a doze, one
of his companions would wake him up, saying that it was time to be
off.</p>
<p class="par">They passed through Bitlis and Marash, in turn. At last,
one morning, as the caravan reached the crest of a hill, one of the
Arabs pointed out to Archag a great city embowered in foliage, lying in
the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1277" title="Source: plan">plain</span>
below. It was Aintab. Twenty-two days had passed since their departure
from Van. The Mussulman showed his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; the
principal buildings; the old half-ruined &ldquo;kala&rdquo; (fortress),
the dome of the Gregorian Cathedral, the towers of the Franciscan
church, the Mosque with needle-pointed minarets, the American Hospital,
and finally the College, its fa&ccedil;ade in English style contrasting
strangely with the native architecture of the other buildings. The
camels, urged on by their drivers, quickened their pace, sniffing and
uttering mournful <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span>cries. They made good time, and toward noon
the caravan drew up at an inn where it was to stay for several
days.</p>
<p class="par">Aintab contained at that time about sixty thousand
inhabitants, twenty-five thousand of whom were Armenians. Mussulmans
and Christians lived in separate quarters of the town, and had little
intercourse with each other. The city lies in a fertile plain watered
by a tributary of the Euphrates. The vine grows luxuriantly on the
surrounding hills, producing grapes that are famous throughout the
country. Aintab, being about seventy kilometers from a railway, has
been very little affected by European civilization. The American
Mission has established here, a hospital, a normal school for girls,
and a college. The latter was founded in 1876 by Dr. Trowbridge, a
Christian and an elect soul, removed, alas, too soon, from the field of
his activity. At the time of which we are speaking, the college had two
hundred students, forty of whom were resident pupils. It was well
situated, on a hill overlooking the city and the plain. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par"></p>
<div class="figure xd21e1286width" id="p061"><img src="images/p061.jpg"

</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">As soon as Archag had had his passport vis&eacute;-ed,
he set out for Central Turkey College. From a long distance he could
see the great red brick building around which were grouped the houses
of the president and professors. The campus was enclosed by a high
wall. At the entrance, Archag had a moment&rsquo;s talk with the
porter, then the heavy iron-barred gates turned on their hinges, and
the lad went up the hill.</p>
<p class="par">Some boys at play in front of the school building looked
with curiosity at the newcomer, and our friend went up to one of them
and asked in Armenian if he could see Badvili (Pastor) Melikian, who
was in charge of the resident students. The boy looked at him in some
surprise, and replied in Turkish,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1295src"
href="#xd21e1295" name="xd21e1295src">2</a> bidding Archag follow
him.</p>
<p class="par">The pastor was busy writing when the boys entered his
office, but his kind face lighted up with a smile, and Archag at once
felt drawn toward the good man. The badvili was perhaps about fifty
years old, a small man, short and stout; a shock of gray hair escaped
from the fez worn like a skull-cap on the back <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>of his
head, and every other minute he would try to push this head-covering
straight, but the rebellious fez resumed its slanting position. After
several years&rsquo; pastoral work in Asia Minor, Mr. Melikian had been
appointed Headmaster at Central Turkey College; here he found himself
much more in his element than in his position of preacher, for he had a
weakness for young people, and was much attached to this school where
he had been one of the first pupils. He shook hands with Archag, and
asked if he had had a good journey, enrolled him at once among the
Sophomores, and assigned him a place in one of the dormitories.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We shall be together,&rdquo; said the other boy,
whose name was Garabed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very glad of that,&rdquo; said Archag,
&ldquo;for you are the only boy I know here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then the two boys went back to the play-ground where
others joined them, and Archag soon found himself taking part in a
lively conversation. They talked about the professors, the president
and his wife, of what they had learned, and what they had yet to learn.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>Then all the Sophomores began playing ball, and
kept up the game until they heard the bell ring for supper.</p>
<p class="par">Three tables were spread in the dining-hall; one for the
preparatory class, the second for the Freshmen and Sophomores, and the
third for the Juniors and Seniors. Archag sat down beside Garabed as
Badvili Melikian was saying grace. The fare would no doubt have seemed
very frugal to American boys; it consisted of tea, bread, and
hard-boiled eggs, but the boys seemed to be satisfied; they dispatched
their supper in ten minutes, and then went back to their play, as
lessons had not yet begun.</p>
<p class="par">Archag walked about arm in arm with Garabed, who told
him his own story. He was a thin, frail-looking lad of seventeen; he
had grown too fast, and was round-shouldered. His face was sweet and
attractive, but unfortunately his expression was spoiled by a large
pair of spectacles which made him look like a little old man. He was a
native of Goerum, near Sivas, and had been two years at Aintab.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was glad to come back,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>the professors are very nice, and the boys are
fine chaps. My father wanted me to go to Marsivan, which is nearer
home, but I preferred to return here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag took a liking to Garabed, and talked to him about
Van and his family, as if he had been an old friend.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Several of my relatives have been students
here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s why I came. My
brother-in-law, who left four years ago, told me a good deal about the
professors. Do you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Here the conversation was interrupted by the sudden
appearance of another boy who jumped on Garabed&rsquo;s back, his eyes
sparkling with mischief.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hi there, Baron<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1327src" href="#xd21e1327" name="xd21e1327src">3</a> Garabed!
what stuff are you pouring into the ears of that innocent
lamb!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to be compared to a lamb,
thank you,&rdquo; said Archag; &ldquo;they are too stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Af&eacute;rim! (That&rsquo;s right) Baron
Archag,&rdquo; said Garabed, &ldquo;take Aram down a peg or two.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The new comer, taking Archag by the arm, said to
him:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come now, Garabed has been telling you all about
the masters; let me draw the portrait of some of your classmates.
First, the wise Garabed himself, who is the choicest specimen of my
acquaintance (this is between ourselves). Over there you may see two
embryo pastors,&rdquo; and he pointed to two stout, stocky boys
chatting in a corner, &ldquo;Soghomon (Solomon) and Boghos (Paul), the
president&rsquo;s favorites; you may judge for yourself of his good
taste. That tall boy, star-gazing, with his hands in his pockets, is a
Junior by the name of Ghevont. The boy in European dress, going up to
him, is Nejib Rossinian, the son of a doctor in Aleppo; he&rsquo;s in
our class, and so is his cousin Dikran; they are an artful pair of
dogs, who are bound to make their way, though they don&rsquo;t always
consider the means. To-morrow you will have to make the acquaintance of
Samou&#299;l and Sumpad, whose brain isn&rsquo;t quite right, and the
five Urfali (natives of Urfa) who always stick together like burrs.
Finally, to complete the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href=
"#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>list of boarders, my humble self,
Aram Nahabedian of Diarbekir, filling the position of clown and joker.
There are a dozen day-scholars in our class, besides, but we only see
them at recitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag was laughing heartily; he was delighted with his
two companions, and already felt himself among friends. At nine
o&rsquo;clock the bell called them in, and they said
&ldquo;Goodnight&rdquo; to Badvili Melikian, who had a pleasant word
for each, as they went upstairs to their dormitories. Archag was in the
room with Aram, Garabed, Soghomon, Nejib and Sumpad. Aram and Nejib
immediately began a pillow-fight, making a fearful commotion. Soghomon,
the fat boy, half-buried beneath a mountain of pillows and coverlets,
lay groaning and beseeching:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, I say! I&rsquo;m smothered! &lsquo;Va&#299;!
Va&#299;! I shall die!&rsquo; who will take pity on me!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Aram and Archag executed a wild dance about their
victim, and the end of it was that Badvili Melikian was obliged to come
and restore order. He lighted a night-lamp for the boys, for Armenians
hate the dark. Once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69"
name="pb69">69</a>]</span>in bed, the boys went to sleep immediately,
and before long came the sound of their regular breathing, together
with Soghomon&rsquo;s snores.</p>
<p class="par">Archag was dreaming that the bells of the Cathedral of
Van were calling him to Mass, when a shake roused him from his sleep.
Aram was pulling him by the arm.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ha&#299;de, are you never going to wake up, you
young mole? Do you think you&rsquo;re going to be allowed to sleep like
that? You&rsquo;re as bad as Soghomon; he can&rsquo;t get out of
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag jumped up and dressed quickly; then the whole
troop went down to breakfast. At half-past seven, professors and
students all gathered in the chapel where Dr. Mills conducted morning
prayers. He spoke to the boys of the child Samuel, urging them to
imitate his love for the Lord.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You come here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not only to
receive your bachelor&rsquo;s degree, which you could get just as well
at Constantinople or Damascus or Smyrna, but in order to become good
and upright Christian men. We desire that these years of study may be
blessed for you, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>and that later, when you are struggling with the
difficulties of life, you may always remember gladly the days you have
spent with us here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He spoke well, and Archag&rsquo;s heart was touched by
his words. How many good resolutions he made then, together with his
comrades! The course of our story will show whether or not he kept
them.</p>
<p class="par">When the speaker had finished, the boys stood up and
sang one of their favorite hymns:</p>
<div class="lgouter">

<p class="par first">The Sophomores were to begin their work in Natural
Science on this morning. The course was given by Professor Pagratian,
who was also proctor of their class. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sheer luck that we have him for
proctor,&rdquo; said Aram to Archag. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a saint come out
from his church, an angel descended from heaven. Do you know, he has an
aureole about his head like Sourp Hagob (Saint James) in my
prayer-book; that&rsquo;s why he never takes off his fez. Last year we
had fat Piralian, who is as harsh as a Turkish pasha. He used to make
us fail just for the pleasure of it; he teaches English, for he spent
several years in Yankeestan.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1389src" href=
"#xd21e1389" name="xd21e1389src">4</a> It was so cold down there his
heart got frozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The arrival of the professor interrupted the flow of
Aram&rsquo;s nonsense; he then began to draw a caricature of Mr.
Piralian, &ldquo;Yankee Doodle,&rdquo; as he called him.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Pagratian was a chilly little man, who kept his
cloak wrapped about him in summer and winter. His face was partly
hidden by a thick black beard, and a shabby old fez covered his
meditative brow, but his luminous black eyes transformed him, banishing
any thought of ridicule that might be suggested by his old-fashioned
clothing. When these eyes, with their look of goodness, had once
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>been fastened on one, they could never be
forgotten. They laid bare one&rsquo;s soul, and seemed to expose
one&rsquo;s bad thoughts only to drive them away and forgive them. And
his voice&mdash;how it would thrill one, now stern and hard, now sweet
and tender as that of a father talking with his child! He had a
profound love for Natural History; his explanations were clear and
interesting and the forty-five minutes in class passed all too quickly
for Archag.</p>
<p class="par">Our friend next made the acquaintance of Professor
Mahdesian, a reserved, scholarly man, who taught Armenian, and of Mr.
Hagopian, the Professor of Turkish. The latter was the veteran of the
college; he had been associated with Dr. Trowbridge in founding it
thirty years before, devoting himself body and soul to his task. The
beginnings had been difficult, partly from lack of funds, but he and
the president had met the situation bravely, teaching nine hours a day.
Success came; pupils flocked in from the most remote regions of the
vast Turkish Empire. The courageous Dr. Trowbridge died before his
time, but Professor Hagopian, more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73"
href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>favored, was permitted to reap
the ample harvest he had sown.</p>
<p class="par">English was the first lesson in the afternoon, and
Archag was impatient to see the famous professor of whom Aram had had
so much to say. Mr. Piralian was still very young. In order to make
himself respected by his pupils he thought it necessary to treat them
with an extreme severity, and would never let the slightest peccadillo
pass unnoticed. The president often had to remonstrate with him on the
subject of the frequent punishments which he inflicted on his pupils.
He had spent several years in the United States, and had been a teacher
there also. He had become accustomed to the ways of American children,
who are notoriously &ldquo;terrors,&rdquo; and now employed the same
methods in dealing with the boys of Aintab that he had found useful
with these others. Apart from that he was a capital teacher, and took
an interest in his pupils, but he never let them see it.</p>
<p class="par">From the first he was prejudiced against Archag; he had
seen him walking about familiarly with Aram, for whom he had an
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>actual antipathy; and that was enough to make him
take a dislike to the new-comer. Then, Archag had learned English from
a Scotchwoman, Miss Dobbie, who spoke broad Scotch, rolling her
r&rsquo;s, aspirating her h&rsquo;s, and saying &ldquo;auld&rdquo; for
&ldquo;old.&rdquo; When he began to read, Professor Piralian made fun
of his pronunciation, and asked him sarcastically what great professor
had taught him English. But Archag, who fairly adored his old teacher,
was wounded to the quick at hearing her made an object of ridicule.</p>
<p class="par">After their lessons, the Sophomores, glad of a chance to
stretch their legs, went out to play football. They ran about, shouting
and pushing each other, with their zoubouns tucked up in their girdles.
Archag, after tripping up Soghomon and Garabed, seized the ball and
threw it with all his might, but he aimed badly, and the ball went
straight through one of the windows of Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s house. The
glass fell in splinters, and Archag cried out in consternation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The only thing for you to do,&rdquo; said
Garabed, <span class="corr" id="xd21e1412" title=
"Source: &rdquo; ">&ldquo;</span>is to go and make your excuses to Mrs.
Spencer; go right off now and do it.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Archag was chagrined at his awkwardness, and reluctant
to present himself before Mrs. Spencer, as a culprit. But the
doctor&rsquo;s wife had seen the accident, and from behind a curtain
she watched Archag coming toward the house, and observed his
embarrassment. When he entered, and stammered out his apologies, she
put him at his ease with a few friendly words:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have had a little misfortune, but that is
nothing, and you will soon play better. Lessons are over, aren&rsquo;t
they, so you can stay and have a cup of tea with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">She gave Archag great pleasure by beginning to talk
about Van, which she had visited three years before. She inquired for
Miss Dobbie, whose guest she had been for a week. Archag&rsquo;s
spirits revived; he told a numbers of stories illustrating the old
lady&rsquo;s untiring kindness, and Mrs. Spencer listened with
interest. She liked the boy&rsquo;s frank countenance and vivacity, and
when Archag left, he was completely won, and promised to come again
often. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h2 class="main">A VISIT TO THE TURKISH BATH</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Thursday was an important day in the
Sophomore&rsquo;s calendar, for on that day Mihran hodja always took
them to the hamam (bath). Garabed, Aram and Archag usually walked in
front; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, as Dikran dubbed them. Archag,
who was usually very sensitive, only laughed at this pleasantry, he was
so happy with his two new friends. Garabed was really his favorite; to
him he could confide his inmost thoughts, and tell his pleasures and
his troubles, sure of finding pity and sympathy. Garabed was the eldest
of eight children; one after another, he had seen all his brothers and
sisters die, the victims of tuberculosis. These bereavements and the
sadness that pervaded his home, had invested him with a certain
melancholy which he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77"
name="pb77">77</a>]</span>had never been able to shake off entirely.
His teachers found him too quick, I was almost going to say too wise,
for his years. Archag, overflowing with life and spirits, occasionally
found him depressing, and at such times he enjoyed the companionship of
his other friend, with whom he could run, jump, and tussle to his
heart&rsquo;s content for Aram was the life and soul of the class, and
though his comrades might stand in fear of his raillery, they also
admired his unwearied good nature and fearless courage.</p>
<p class="par">It was he, as usual, who took the lead in the
conversation on this Thursday, and his friends were content to listen,
and laugh at his sallies.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Great news!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We are going
to have a new professor of French.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Garabed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
President Mills going to teach us any more?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, then, who is this new teacher?&rdquo; asked
Archag.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mr. Hagopian?&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Mr. Pagratian?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yok, yok (no, no).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then I give up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps he is a Frenchman?&rdquo; suggested
Garabed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bravo, my dear philosopher, you have guessed
right; that is, he&rsquo;s a Swiss from Geneva. Dr. Mills spoke to my
uncle about him, and he told me yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The three friends proceeded to share the news with their
companions and they all entered the hamam in a state of great
excitement. After undressing, the boys bound cloths about their loins,
tied on bath-slippers, and passed into the &ldquo;harara,&rdquo; a
narrow room with temperature at white heat. Thanks to the exertions of
the &ldquo;abou saboun,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1463src"
href="#xd21e1463" name="xd21e1463src">1</a> who lathered and rubbed
them thoroughly, they were soon perspiring freely. Aram, seeing
everyone busy, took advantage of the situation to play a thousand
pranks; now he pinched fat Soghomon, or again, took possession of all
the soap. When the boys were all sufficiently red, they left the harara
for the &ldquo;hanefije,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79"
href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>where they cooled themselves off
with water made increasingly cold. Then they wrapped big sheets around
them, twisted woolen bands about their heads, and returned to the
&ldquo;mashlach&rdquo; (dressing-room). There they sat down in little
groups on the divans, and began to play checkers and talk, at the same
time disposing of a goodly number of cups of coffee.</p>
<p class="par">The hamam plays an important part in the life of
Orientals; they go there for sanitary reasons, but still more for
pleasure; it is really a place of recreation for them, just as the
theater or concert-hall is for us.</p>
<p class="par">Archag, Garabed and Samou&#299;l were playing cards.
Aram had mysteriously disappeared, and our two friends had asked
Samou&#299;l to take a hand with them. Samou&#299;l, though quite
fifteen years of age, looked barely thirteen. During the massacres of
1894 his parents and two older brothers had been killed by the Kurds,
and the enemy had left him for dead beside the bodies of his relatives.
A charitable person had taken and cared for him, and it was only by a
miracle that his life was preserved; indeed, this life <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>was
rather a burden to him than otherwise, for he was pining away. A wound
in the hip had left him lame, for the bone was affected. Dr. Spencer
had operated, but the trouble had spread, making a second operation
necessary. The poor boy knew quite well that he would not live to grow
up, and he would speak of his going to heaven as we should allude to a
railway journey. Mrs. Spencer was always doing something for him; she
had placed him in the college, where masters and pupils alike loved him
for his sweet nature.</p>
<p class="par">The game of cards was suddenly interrupted by angry
cries:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;By the beard of my father, I&rsquo;ll pay you for
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll break every bone in your
body!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">What had happened was this: Aram, bent on mischief as
usual, had furtively stirred a big spoonful of powder into
Dikran&rsquo;s coffee; the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1483" title=
"Source: later">latter</span> had discovered the perpetrator of the
trick and had given him two resounding slaps in the face; Aram hit
back, but Nejib came to his cousin&rsquo;s aid, and Aram could not cope
with the two. Archag, seeing his friend attacked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>by two
lusty opponents, ran to help him without stopping to find out what the
quarrel was about; he pitched into Nejib and punched him in the chest
and stomach while Aram struggled with Dikran. In a short time, Mihran
hodja and the older boys succeeding in separating the combatants, but
Aram&rsquo;s nose was bleeding, Nejib had a black eye, and Archag and
Dikran were covered with bruises. It took some time to quiet them down,
for they were all shouting at once, without listening to what any one
was saying. Aram was punished by two days on bounds; the others got off
with a severe reprimand.</p>
<p class="par">On that same evening, the Sophomores were invited to a
&ldquo;sociable&rdquo; at the house of President Mills. This invitation
was a real event in the monotony of the college routine; the boys began
to get ready quite two hours in advance. When they had completed their
washing, shaving, shoe-polishing and prinking, they all started off in
a body.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Mills was waiting for them in her drawing-room. She
was a pleasing and lively woman, not more than thirty years of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>age, and the boys were much attached to her. She
was born at Aintab, and spoke both Turkish and Armenian like a native.
It was she who was doing most of the talking now, although she was
seconded in her efforts by another American lady, Miss Wylie, the
directress of the Girls&rsquo; Normal School, a little person of
uncertain age, dressed in red silk, with her hair cut short like a
boy&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="par">Archag, accustomed only to the simple dwellings of the
interior of the country, was much impressed by the arm-chairs and
pictures which gave the room an air of great luxury. He sat up very
straight in a rocking-chair, not daring to move a muscle, and looked
with envy at Aram, who was rocking away carelessly, as if he had been
used to it all his life. Following Oriental custom, Archag had left his
red leather slippers behind the door, while his companions had all worn
shoes and kept them on. To add to his embarrassment, there was a great
hole in one of his socks, and at his slightest movement his big toe
would protrude. The other boys had put on European dress for the
occasion, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>his zouboun looked quite out of place in this
grand drawing-room.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The very first time I go to town I must buy a
European coat and pantaloons.&rdquo; (he called them
&ldquo;bantoloons.&rdquo;)</p>
<p class="par">Suddenly, as he was talking to himself, he felt
something cold tickling the soles of his feet. One bound took him into
the middle of the room, but in his haste, unfortunately, he caught at a
table-scarf, dragging it off, together with a handsome
jardini&egrave;re which fell, broken into a thousand fragments.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The clumsy boy!&rdquo; said the president under
his breath.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Mills was in dismay; she thought of all the trouble
she had had in bringing this ornament to Aintab on her last journey
back from America; it was a present from her brother, besides, and
there it was, all broken to bits by the clumsiness of a country
lad.</p>
<p class="par">Archag stood staring vacantly, his ears tingling, until
Mrs. Mills took pity on him and told him he need not feel so badly
about it; an accident might happen to any one. But <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>Archag
made no reply; he had not heard a word she said.</p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Mills made a gesture of impatience: she thought the
boy very ill-bred, and that he might at least have offered some
apology. If she had observed him a little more closely she would
probably have changed her opinion. In order to enliven the company and
make a little diversion, she sat down at the piano and asked Garabed
and Dikran to accompany her. The boys always took their mandolins with
them when they were invited to the president&rsquo;s house, for it was
a great pleasure for them to play with Mrs. Mills.</p>
<p class="par">At nine o&rsquo;clock, tea and sweetmeats were served,
and then the boys took their leave, after thanking their hosts for
their kindness.</p>
<p class="par">Then Garabed tried to console Archag:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I say, whatever got into you? I didn&rsquo;t see
what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, if you were ticklish, and somebody began to
scratch the soles of your feet with a pen-knife, I guess you would
jump, just like me.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href=
"#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wonder who could have played that trick on
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, and what good would it do if
I did? The mischief is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But now Aram had joined them: &ldquo;Listen,
Archag,&rdquo; he said resolutely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all my fault, and
I assure you on my honor I&rsquo;m broken-hearted over it. You know how
I love to play tricks. Well, when I saw you with your legs holding on
to the chair like cork-screws, I couldn&rsquo;t resist the temptation
to make them change their position, but I never dreamed of causing such
an accident. I let you come away first, so I might speak to Mrs. Mills,
and I owned up to her. And now I have an idea: we&rsquo;ll go and buy a
pretty table-cover, you and I, and send it to her; then she will
understand that we are doing what we can to make up for our
stupidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag clapped his hands:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s a fine idea, and we&rsquo;ll
put on the outside: &lsquo;From Aram and Archag, in memory of their
awkwardness.&rsquo; I was very angry with you for a minute, but now I
forgive you with all my heart; you just wanted to tease <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>me, but
as for me, I have been too awkward for words.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He held out his hand to Aram, who gripped it again and
again.</p>
<p class="par">A few days after this, Mrs. Mills showed her husband a
charming table-cover of white silk, embroidered with arabesques, and
handed him a note.</p>
<p class="par">The president read it.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this boy from
Van is a perfect puzzle to me. First he is awkward as he can be, breaks
your jardini&egrave;re, and never offers a single word of apology; then
here comes this present, which shows a delicacy of feeling rare in a
boy of his age.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He is exceptionally shy; but I believe there is
good stuff in Archag, and that we shall make something of him. Mrs.
Spencer has spoken to me of him very favorably, and you know how
accurate her judgment is.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, yes; only don&rsquo;t spoil him for me by
flattery and kind attentions.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">ARCHAG&rsquo;S FIRST TROUSERS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">For several weeks the boys talked of nothing but
the arrival of Monsieur Bernier, their future French teacher. One
morning the president received a telegram from Aleppo announcing the
arrival of the young man that same evening, and by way of doing him
honor, Dr. Mills gave all the classes a half-holiday. The Sophomores
were talking of their new professor:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s young or old,&rdquo; said
Samou&#299;l.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You little fool,&rdquo; muttered Dikran,
&ldquo;you may depend upon it that no man of experience would leave
Europe to come out and bury himself in a hole like this; I bet
he&rsquo;s a greenhorn with just five hairs on his chin.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen his photograph,&rdquo; announced
Aram, with the air of a judge revealing a state secret. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">A dozen voices cried out at once:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is he like? What is he like?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Aram straightened up with an air of importance:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This morning I was in the president&rsquo;s
office to show him the <i>pensum</i> he gave me yesterday; I was
looking around at his books and his desk, and there I stopped, as I
noticed a photograph half hidden by a pile of letters. I peeped, I
stood an tiptoe, but couldn&rsquo;t manage to see a thing. All at once
Mrs. Mills called out, &lsquo;Dearie, come and get a piece of
cake.&rsquo; Dearie didn&rsquo;t wait to be called twice. &lsquo;Wait
here for me a moment,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;some one is calling
me,&rsquo; and as soon as he had closed the door I pounced on the
photograph. It was the picture of a nice, slender young man, and he had
written at the top: Henri Bernier. I had barely time to put it back
before the president came back.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boys quite envied Aram for having seen the new
master before his arrival, and since they had the afternoon free they
decided to go out and meet him in a body. Aram was the only dissenter:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, no! I shan&rsquo;t go; I shall see him soon
enough. I haven&rsquo;t time, anyhow; Garabed and I are going to town
with Archag to help him choose a suit of clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; whispered Dikran in his
cousin&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;The young savage is getting civilized; not a
bad idea. He won&rsquo;t disgrace us all, next time we are invited to
the president&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Aram and his two friends went to ask Badvili Melikian
for passes (the boys were not allowed to leave the campus without a
written permission); then they went off whistling, on their way to the
bazaar.</p>
<p class="par">First they went into a haberdasher&rsquo;s shop to buy
stiff collars and a necktie.</p>
<p class="par">The shopkeeper showed them a box containing a dozen
cravats of every color of the rainbow, and the three boys stood
hesitating before such magnificence. Aram recommended an apple-green
tie and one of cherry-red, by turns.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The green one,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is very
distingu&eacute;; but Dikran has a red one that his brother brought
home from Beyrout, and he&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90"
href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>just stuck on it. He declares
you can&rsquo;t find anything like it here; it will be an awful blow to
him if you buy one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag, a modern Paris, confronted by the beauties of
the cravats, underwent all the torments of indecision. Finally Garabed,
who had said nothing, jogged his elbow:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If I were you, I should take this pale blue one,
then you will be wearing the Armenian color,&rdquo; and he pointed to a
cravat of coarse silk and cotton.</p>
<p class="par">Before the beauty of this sky-blue tie, the charms of
the two others paled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that or none,&rdquo; said Archag to
himself.</p>
<p class="par">But unfortunately, the shopkeeper asked a mejidieh
(ninety cents) for it, a fabulous price for a necktie. The three boys
simultaneously uttered cries of indignation, and turned to leave the
shop.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Eh, l&aacute;, l&aacute;, Effendis, not so fast!
How much do you offer me?&rdquo; It was now the shopkeeper&rsquo;s turn
to be alarmed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Twelve piastres (fifty-three cents),&rdquo; said
Archag.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Twelve piastres! you wish to ruin me <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>then? A
cravat that comes straight from Vienna, and cost me three piastres
duty! I will let you have it for eighteen piastres.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Again a pretended exit of the shoppers.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, after twenty minutes of haggling and excited
talk, Archag got his famous necktie for fifteen piastres, and our three
friends left the shop radiant, escorted by the merchant, cringing and
bowing repeatedly.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good business!&rdquo; he said to himself, as soon
as their backs were turned. &ldquo;I have had that ugly old rag in the
shop for two years, and never expected to get rid of it at such a
price.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The tailor&rsquo;s shop was only a few steps away.
Archag, acting on his friend&rsquo;s advice, bought a suit of serge. He
tried it on at once, and then looked at himself in a mirror, surveying
with great satisfaction his slender figure, his snow-white collar and
blue cravat, and as a finishing touch, a scarf-pin in the shape of a
four-leaf clover, the gift of his two friends. The merchant, his
clerks, Garabed and Aram all declared that the suit fitted him like a
glove. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Archag, however, felt very much hampered by his
trousers, which hit against his legs at every step; his suspenders
pulled, and his stiff collar choked him, and he gave a sigh of envy as
he looked at his flannel robe lying on a chair. But he paid his bill of
two pounds and a half, took his zouboun on his arm, and went back to
college with his companions.</p>

<p class="figureHead">THE ARABA</p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">A party of students had gone out to meet Monsieur
Bernier, and the others were waiting for him on the campus. About
fifteen minutes after Archag and his friends had rejoined their mates,
the sound of a carriage was heard in the distance. &ldquo;They are
coming, they are coming!&rdquo; called a voice, and they all ran to the
foot of the hill. Dr. Mills and Dr. Spencer, on horseback, were at the
head of the party; the boys, a few of them on bicycles, the greater
number on donkeys or walking, were crowding about the araba, a peculiar
sort of Turkish carriage used by travelers in the interior of Asia
Minor. It is a wagon without springs, having a hood of gray cloth;
trunks are fastened on anywhere, underneath, or at the sides of the
vehicle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>The traveler lies on a mattress; he has a basket
of provisions at hand, in which he is likely to forage very often, to
beguile the length of the journey. Consider, dear reader, that the
carriage-roads in Turkey are often little better than country lanes,
that it is sometimes necessary to drive across rivers and marshes, or
again, to follow rough, stony roads, and run the risk of being attacked
by brigands, and you will realize that a journey in an araba is no
pleasure trip. Monsieur Bernier had come from Alexandretta, and had
spent three days in his araba; he had been obliged to stay each night
at a khan, where he had been almost devoured by vermin; it was
therefore a great relief to him to find himself at last at his
journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p class="par">As he got out of the araba he was hailed with shouts of
welcome by the boys:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hip, hip, hip, ra, ra, ra, hip ra r&eacute;,
bomba, bomba, C. T. C. (Central Turkey College).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boys of Aintab being students in an American
institution, had adopted the American college custom of having their
own peculiar yell. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96"
name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Monsieur Bernier had a passion for travel, and after
pocketing his university diploma, had set out for distant lands. He was
very young, so young that some of his own pupils, great bearded fellows
of twenty, looked older than he. He thanked the boys for their kind
reception, and then followed President Mills to the house in which he
was to live. For a long time he could hear from his room the
&ldquo;hip, hip, hip, ra, ra, ra,&rdquo; shouted in his honor, and
these expressions of welcome so cheered him up that from that first
evening he felt a warm attachment for his pupils, which never
altered.</p>
<p class="par">That evening, the Sophomores were in their study-hall as
usual, in charge of Mihran hodja, but as they had had a holiday in the
afternoon, they were free to do as they pleased. Most of them were
reading. Archag, Aram, and two of the Urfali were playing chess. Archag
kept losing, and after a while gave up, tired of his bad luck.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough of that,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;ask Samou&#299;l to take my place.&rdquo; Samou&#299;l agreed;
he was a good player, but he found a formidable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>opponent
in Aram, and the group soon became very much excited. Archag watched
them for a moment, then went off to chat with Garabed in another corner
of the room. Nejib was sitting near them, absorbed in a book.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hi, there,&rdquo; said Archag, &ldquo;what are
you buried in so deep? You haven&rsquo;t taken your eyes off your old
book for the last hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He drew near without ceremony, and read out the title of
the book at the top of his voice: &ldquo;The Arabian Nights!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">If a thunderbolt had fallen in the hall the boys could
hardly have been more startled; they knew how severe Dr. Mills was upon
any who read improper stories; and &ldquo;The Arabian Nights&rdquo; had
a terrible reputation at Aintab.</p>
<p class="par">Profound silence followed Archag&rsquo;s imprudent
words; the boys dared not breathe a syllable. Mihran hodja turned pale,
went to Nejib and asked for his book. The boy handed it to him without
a word, but he was as white as a ghost. The master turned over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>the leaves, hoping the book might prove to be an
expurgated edition, put it in his pocket with a sigh, and left the
room. When he had closed the door, Nejib flung himself upon Archag and
gave him a vigorous box on the ear.</p>
<p class="par">Our friend tripped him up, and when his opponent was on
the floor, punched his chest. The boys had hard work to separate them,
for they were both very angry.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As if I knew &lsquo;The Arabian Nights&rsquo; was
a forbidden book!&rdquo; said Archag. &ldquo;I simply asked him what he
was reading. Don&rsquo;t be worried; I shan&rsquo;t speak another word
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Nejib, for his part, insisted that Archag had done it on
purpose, that he was a spy and ought to be expelled from college.</p>
<p class="par">Finally, peace was restored after a fashion.
Archag&rsquo;s anger cooled quickly, and he thought no more about the
matter. But Nejib did not forget. President Mills gave him a punishment
of three days on bounds, on bread and water, together with a very bad
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>conduct mark, and also wrote a letter of complaint
to Dr. Rossinian. The young fellow, who was quarrelsome by nature, then
merely waited for an opportunity to take his revenge. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Archag worked at his lessons with enthusiasm, and
the days and weeks passed very quickly. Most of the professors admired
his earnestness and intelligence, and were pleased with the progress he
made, but unfortunately he had failed to win the favor of Mr. Piralian,
who continued to dislike him. It must be confessed that Archag showed
little interest in his English lessons; he had never been willing to
alter his pronunciation, for he considered Miss Dobbie an excellent
teacher, and since she said &ldquo;auld&rdquo; and
&ldquo;gir-r-l&rdquo;, of course that must be right. Therefore, he
argued, Professor Piralian was in the wrong and spoke incorrectly; he
did not know how to teach, and it was not worth while to work very
hard. Our friend thus drew a quantity of false conclusions, with the
superb recklessness of youth. In his Christmas <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>reports he was marked &ldquo;good,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;very good&rdquo; in everything except English, in which he had
only &ldquo;medium&rdquo;; but this made very little impression upon
him; he knew that he had not done good work, and did not expect
anything better. Garabed stood first in the class, then came Dikran and
Archag. Aram was fifth. Nejib, who had always been among the first,
stood only eighth because of his bad conduct mark.</p>
<p class="par">The advent of the Christmas holidays was, of course,
hailed by the boys with shouts of joy. What great games they would
play! What a jolly time they were going to have during those two weeks!
On New Year&rsquo;s Day, the Sophomores were invited to the house of
Hosep Paelian, one of the day pupils, and they had a delightful time
with him.</p>
<p class="par">They were constantly going to the bazaar to do their
Christmas shopping, and returning surrounded with an air of mystery,
bringing big parcels which they hid in their trunks.</p>
<p class="par">At this point I hear my readers exclaim, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>&ldquo;What! Christmas after New Year&rsquo;s
Day? The world must certainly be upside-down over there!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It does indeed seem odd to us to celebrate the birth of
Jesus Christ in the month of January. But the Gregorians use the Greek
calendar, which is twelve days later than ours. They keep Christmas on
the Feast of the Three Kings, the sixth day of January, that is, the
eighteenth, New Style.</p>
<p class="par">President Mills had a pine tree brought from Amanus, a
mountain to the west of Aintab. For several days the sun was hidden by
snow-storms, and this Oriental Christmas differed little from the same
season in the North. In the afternoon of Christmas Day, Professor
Pagratian conducted a service in the college chapel, after which
masters and pupils gathered together for dinner in the great
dining-room.</p>
<p class="par">The menu consisted of turkey with chestnuts, and a
dessert of grapes and oranges. The boys were little used to delicacies,
especially to meat, and their eyes shone with eagerness in anticipation
of this feast of good things. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103"
href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>The professors were seated at
different tables; Mihran hodja and Monsieur Bernier sat with the
Sophomores, one at either end of the table. The young Swiss smiled as
he looked at his plate, on which were large slices of turkey, pilaaf
(rice), and chestnuts, arranged in the form of a tower. Oriental usage
requires that the plates be filled to the extent of their capacity, but
it is very bad form not to leave a considerable part of what has been
given, or one is set down as a gourmand.</p>
<p class="par">Monsieur Bernier was preparing to do justice to his
dinner when he observed that he had neither knife nor fork. Supposing
it to be a mere oversight, he asked Garabed to get him a knife. After
quite five minutes the boy returned in some embarrassment, saying he
could not find one. Aram then offered his pen-knife, which,
boy-fashion, he was in the habit of using for all sorts of purposes;
Monsieur Bernier recalled having seen him digging in the earth with
this same knife a few days before, and considered it more hygienic to
decline the offer. He noticed how his companions rolled up their meat
in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>soft, thin bread, using a spoon for the rice and
chestnuts, so he did the same, to the great delight of the boys.</p>
<p class="par">The tree had been lighted in the study hall; the Seniors
had decorated it with cotton-wool, oranges, apples and gilded nuts, and
had laid out the presents on tables. The boys sang a hymn in English;
then they made haste to open their parcels, and before long every one
was engrossed with his own gifts. Archag received one Turkish pound
(about four dollars and a half) from his parents, a book from his
sister and another from Garabed, and Aram&rsquo;s photograph. Dikran
was manipulating a microscope which his brother had sent him from New
York. Boghos had a kodak from America, which he was showing with pride
to his friend Soghomon. No one had been forgotten; for the less
fortunate boys whose parents had not been able to send them anything,
Mrs. Mills had provided remembrances. After all the presents had been
duly admired, the boys put them aside, to play games. At ten
o&rsquo;clock, tea and caghk&eacute;s (little cakes) were served, and
at length the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span>boys went off to their dormitories, very happy
after their festival.</p>
<p class="par">The next day, the weather was so cold that every one
stayed indoors, and Archag, after reading a little while, took a fancy
to go upstairs to the museum, which contained good specimens of the
flora and fauna of the country.</p>
<p class="par">He spent a long time looking at the different
collections of plants, the stuffed birds and the shells; but when that
was finished, he did not know what to do with himself. What was there
to do, all the rest of the afternoon? As his eyes wandered about the
room, they fell on a cabinet standing partly open. He went up to it,
and pushing back the door, saw that it contained some rare objects:
some insects and Professor Piralian&rsquo;s collection of butterflies.
This worthy man had a mania for collecting; he had hunted for stones,
fossils, butterflies and antique coins, by turns; at present he was
asking every one for postage-stamps, which he carefully pasted in a new
album. His collection of butterflies included some superb specimens
which he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>caught himself during a stay in Mexico. On his
return to Aintab he had presented the collection to the college, where
it was highly appreciated.</p>
<p class="par">As the thermometer registered several degrees below
zero, the furnace fire was burning at full blast, and the air in the
museum, already impregnated with camphor and naphtha, was suffocating.
Before long, Archag&rsquo;s head was burning; he threw open one of the
windows near the door, and took a good breath of fresh air. Then he
returned to the cabinet and took out a glass box containing the finest
specimen of the Piralian collection. It was beginning to grow dark, so
he took the box to the window, which he had left open. He stood looking
at the marvelous insects with their iridescent wings of blue and green
and gold, and was amusing himself by trying to decipher the Latin
names, when he felt a smart blow on his arm. The force of the sudden
jar made him let go of the box, and down it fell with a crash, on the
stone pavement of the courtyard. For an instant Archag stood motionless
with fright; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>then he rushed into the corridor, where he heard
a sound of retreating footsteps. He went back to the museum, and
looking from the window he could see the shapeless fragments of the box
down below. A ray of hope flashed across his mind; could it be,
perhaps, that the precious insects had not been injured?</p>
<p class="par">Running downstairs two steps at a time, the next moment
he was in the courtyard. Alas! the butterflies were ruined; most of
them were reduced to powder. In the face of this disaster Archag felt
powerless, constrained by an agony of fear. He could not bring himself
to think of the thing he ought to do, to go at once to Professor
Piralian and tell him frankly what had happened. His only thought was
that he should be expelled from the college. How dreadful, oh, how very
dreadful!</p>
<p class="par">When he entered the schoolroom, he was so pale that
Garabed was frightened:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why, what is the matter with you? Are you
ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have a bad headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He took up a book, but the words danced <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>before his eyes, without conveying the slightest
meaning to his mind.</p>
<p class="par">Garabed, seeing that he did not want to talk, asked no
more questions. Every time the door was opened, the culprit trembled:
now, his misdeed had been discovered, he thought, and some one was
coming to question the boys. His heart beat like a trip-hammer, and he
felt as if he must suffocate. The evening passed without any
disturbance, but Archag had a restless night; he kept dreaming that he
had been sent away in disgrace, and his classmates&rsquo; shouts of
derisive laughter seemed to ring in his ears. Several times he woke up
with a start, to hear Garabed anxiously asking if he were ill, and if
he would like to have Badvili Melikian called. He would reply
impatiently that he did not need anything, and turn over on the other
side.</p>
<p class="par">The next morning, Dr. Mills came into the schoolroom
before prayers, looking very grave.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now for it!&rdquo; said Archag to himself.</p>
<p class="par">The president told them what had happened, and made the
misdeed appear very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"
name="pb109">109</a>]</span>disgraceful. When he called on the guilty
one to come forward and acknowledge his fault, our friend rose
mechanically and went to the desk.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It was I who did it,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You! you!&rdquo; repeated Dr. Mills. &ldquo;A boy
whom we have all loved! How can you have done a thing like that? It
can&rsquo;t be possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">However, he led the culprit away to his office, and
questioned him closely. Archag confessed to opening the cabinet and
taking the box of butterflies to the window in order to see them
better, but when he said that some one had pushed him, his judge smiled
incredulously. He called Badvili Melikian, who assured him that, with
the exception of Nejib who was in the city, none of the Sophomores had
left the study-hall that afternoon.</p>
<p class="par">Archag had always been on good terms with his
classmates, and it seemed impossible that any one of them should have
wanted to play him such a trick. Dr. Mills questioned the boys again,
but each gave the same reply: not one of them had gone up to the museum
that day. Indeed, the president asked these <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>questions merely to satisfy his own conscience;
he was quite convinced of Archag&rsquo;s guilt. Professor Piralian had
often complained of his bad conduct and lack of application; he had
just given him a &ldquo;medium&rdquo; mark in English. It seemed
therefore quite probable that Archag had deliberately taken revenge on
his teacher by destroying his collection.</p>
<p class="par">All the professors assembled in the president&rsquo;s
room to talk the matter over, and Dr. Mills laid Archag&rsquo;s case
before them at some length, and then waited for their counsel. A
painful silence followed; Armenians hate to give an opinion outright;
they prefer to evade the main question, and to prolong their
discussions without coming to any decision.</p>
<p class="par">At last Professor Pagratian rose and addressed the
president:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I must say, that for my part, I have always found
Archag loyal and truthful.&rdquo; A murmur of assent was heard from the
other masters. &ldquo;I have watched him both in and out of
study-hours, and it is my private opinion that one of his classmates
really did give him a push by way of revenge. I have my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>own
suspicions, too, as to that, which I shall do my utmost to verify. The
lad is diffident and awkward; he did wrong not to confess his fault at
once, but he made up for that by admitting his guilt before the whole
college. You will reply that he could not do otherwise, since Badvili
Melikian knew he was in the museum that afternoon. I do not admit that
argument; if he had meant to lie about it all, he would have denied the
whole or nothing. Let us punish him for his disobedience in handling
the collection; that was his only fault, and does not deserve expulsion
from the college.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The professors discussed the matter at length; Monsieur
Bernier and Badvili Melikian agreed with Professor Pagratian; the
others wished Archag to be expelled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe,&rdquo; said the president,
at last, &ldquo;that we shall ever come to an agreement. I suggest
therefore that we leave the decision to Professor Piralian, who is
better able to judge than we.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The professor had received a grievous blow in the
destruction of his precious collection, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>and he had none too
much sympathy with Archag. But at the moment of giving his judgment he
seemed to see his pupil&rsquo;s bright face with its frank and
straightforward expression, and he felt that eyes like his could not
have lied. His decision was made.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I ask you to
keep Archag here; five days on bounds will be sufficient punishment for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Meanwhile our friend was wandering about the campus like
a lost soul. He had gone off by himself, ashamed to let his grief be
seen. Was he really going to be expelled? All his pride revolted at the
thought. He would cheerfully take any punishment if only he might be
spared this disgrace.</p>
<p class="par">After a while he heard someone calling him:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Archag, Archag!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Dr. Mills is asking for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag entered the room where all the professors were
seated around the table.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said the president to him,
&ldquo;you have committed a serious fault in touching <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>the
collection of butterflies after having been told not to do so. The loss
you have occasioned to our museum is irreparable. We are willing,
however, to take into consideration your youth and inexperience, as
extenuating circumstances, since you are just at the beginning of your
college career. You will have five days on bounds, and be marked zero
for conduct in your next report.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then I am not expelled?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No; we think you are sufficiently punished in
this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! thank you, thank you, Machallah!&rdquo; cried
Archag. He kissed the president&rsquo;s hand again and again, then fled
precipitately to hide the sobs that stifled him. <span class=

<p class="par first">After the affair of the butterflies, the
Sophomores held themselves somewhat aloof from Archag, for they could
not forgive him for saying that one of them had pushed him. They all
felt insulted by this accusation, and believed him to be a hypocrite
and a liar. One day, when Archag was about to join a group at cards,
Dikran got up, refusing to play with him. Garabed was the only one who
remained unchanged; he was firmly persuaded of his friend&rsquo;s
innocence, and was always ready to cheer him up with a kind word or
look of sympathy. And indeed, Archag had need of it; he felt terribly
isolated, and was hurt by the silent condemnation of his classmates and
some of the professors. Up to this time he had been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>petted and flattered by every one; now, fallen
thus abruptly from his pedestal, he could not accustom himself to his
unhappy circumstances.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You look like a ghost,&rdquo; said Aram.</p>
<p class="par">He believed Archag to be innocent, and pitied him
sincerely, but was beginning to be bored by his friend&rsquo;s
depression. Archag had had a large share in all his pranks and games,
but this pale lad who could neither laugh nor joke was not his old
Archag at all, and Aram insensibly began to drift away from him. Two of
the Urfali became his special cronies, for with them he could play all
sorts of pranks. Archag observed this change with bitterness of spirit,
but he was too proud to tell Aram the whole story. He fancied that
every one except Garabed despised him. He had never ventured to go and
see Mrs. Spencer again; whenever he saw her at a distance he would go
out of his way to avoid her. One day, however, as he was returning from
the bazaar, he saw her suddenly at a street corner. For an instant he
thought of turning back: but that would have been cowardly; and he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>kept on his way. The missionary&rsquo;s wife
had, of course, observed his small artifices; she herself had never
believed him guilty, and was glad of this opportunity to speak an
encouraging word to him.</p>
<p class="par">Archag touched his fez by way of salutation, and was
about to pass on, but Mrs. Spencer stopped him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I was just wondering what had become of you; it
is a long time since I have seen you. I am going to the hospital, and
you must walk on a little way with me; you will tell me what is
weighing on your heart, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag could not refuse; his questioner looked at him
with such a kind smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You have had a hard trial,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;but still, you mustn&rsquo;t lose courage; you will see that
everything will be cleared up by and by; as for me, I have never
believed you guilty of a falsehood. Don&rsquo;t let yourself be crushed
by misfortune; this is probably your first experience. Ah, well! Bear
it like a man. Redouble your efforts to do away with the bad impression
you have made on some of your teachers; above all, show yourself
obedient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>and docile toward Professor Piralian; make an
extra effort to please him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He hates me,&rdquo; Archag could not help saying,
&ldquo;he shows it in all sorts of ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What nonsense you are talking! If he had hated
you, would he have asked Dr. Mills to let you stay here? You have him
to thank for not being expelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag was dumb with astonishment; the iron vise which
had gripped his heart for the last three weeks, was relaxing its hold;
he was finding once more a little of that sympathy in which he had no
longer dared to believe. With a lighter heart he took leave of the
doctor&rsquo;s wife, and went back to the college whistling.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are entirely changed,&rdquo; said Garabed on
his return; &ldquo;what has come over you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy to-day.&rdquo; And he told his
friend about the conversation with Mrs. Spencer.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; replied Garabed, &ldquo;the best
people have kept their friendship for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Professor Pagratian also took a great interest in
Archag, and often invited him to his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb118" href="#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span>house with Garabed.
What happy evenings those were for our two friends! Mrs. Pagratian and
her two daughters would mend a great pile of linen, while the professor
smoked his narguileh, and talked about his youthful days of poverty and
hardship. He did not remember his father; the eldest of six children,
he had been obliged to go to work while still very young, in order to
help his mother. At the age of eighteen he was a journeyman weaver,
earning a mejidi&eacute; (ninety cents) a week. An American missionary
whom he met occasionally, gave him a copy of the New Testament, and he
used to read it privately with a companion of his named Krikorian. The
Epistles of Saint Paul made a deep impression upon these young men, and
then Dr. Trowbridge became interested in the two friends, and used to
pray with them and explain the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When he talked to us,&rdquo; said the professor,
&ldquo;it was as if scales fell from our eyes; we felt a horror of our
sins, and a thirst for truth and righteousness.... One Christmas
evening when Krikorian and I had been praying <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>with
more than ordinary fervor, we seemed to hear Jesus Christ calling us.
Our hearts leaped for joy; that was the most beautiful day of our life,
and we always think of it with tears of gratitude. Dr. Trowbridge was
at that time engaged in laying the foundations of the college, and he
proposed that we should fit ourselves to become teachers in his school.
I needn&rsquo;t tell you how glad we were to act on his suggestion. We
spent four years in America, and then we returned to work with our
benefactor. Alas! God called him suddenly to Himself. Such men are rare
indeed, and his death was a very great loss to Aintab.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">These talks made a deep impression on Archag. He had
always supposed that it would be time enough to think about religion
when he was grown up. But his teacher had been less than twenty years
old when the Spirit of Christ took possession of his whole being, soul
and body; and how happy he seemed!</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes Mrs. Pagratian (whose mother was German), and
her daughters, would sing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=
"#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>old songs in the dialect of
Swabia, or perhaps Monsieur Bernier would join the little group, and
talk about Switzerland, a country well-known to the Pagratians, for the
professor had studied for two years at Basle, and preferred the Swiss
country to America.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In Switzerland,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;the
people enjoy life; in America they do business.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When Monsieur Bernier spoke of the liberty of his
compatriots, the poor Armenians could not suppress a sigh of envy, and
Mrs. Pagratian would wipe away a secret tear, for she lived in constant
dread of a fresh massacre.</p>
<p class="par">These evenings were a blessed influence for Archag; he
threw himself into his work with new ardor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Something seems to have changed that boy
entirely,&rdquo; said Mr. Piralian to Professor Pagratian. &ldquo;I
never could do anything with him before, but since that famous affair
of the butterflies he has grown polite, studious, and attentive in
class, whereas formerly he was always thinking about something else. I
actually <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>believe I shall succeed in correcting his
horrible accent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That would almost make up for the loss of your
collection,&rdquo; replied his colleague, laughing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes; only if I had to gain the progress of each
of my pupils at the cost of one of my collections, I should soon be
ruined!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag, for his part, saw that Mr. Piralian no longer
retained his former prejudice against him, and he even came to like the
English lessons. His classmates, seeing that he was reinstated in the
good graces of the masters, left off tormenting him. But Archag still
avoided them; he was constantly with Garabed; they prepared their
lessons together, and then went off on long walks, exchanging ideas
about every subject that came into their heads. But their favorite
topic of conversation was Armenia, so cruelly oppressed and tried.</p>
<p class="par">Archag had never thought very much about his country. He
loved it, to be sure, and pitied it, but that was all. Garabed, who was
older and more reflective by nature, made him <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>feel
ashamed of his ignorance. He showed him Armenia, wasted by continual
massacres, but yet alive; he described the deplorable condition of
their fellow-countrymen, the better and more intelligent of whom had
fled to America; he told him the story of the heroic siege of
Zeitoun&mdash;how the town held out for seven months against the
Turkish forces which had come to exterminate it; or again, of the great
achievements of Andranick<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1860src" href=
"#xd21e1860" name="xd21e1860src">1</a> the revolutionary leader, who
had dared resist the Kurds, and had been victorious.</p>
<p class="par">Archag&rsquo;s eyes were opened; as his love of country
increased, it became the central force in his life. Together the two
boys studied the history of their country, and took pleasure in
speaking Armenian, although Garabed insisted that they must always
speak Turkish in the presence of the other boys. The reason for this we
shall see presently. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"

Andranick, a popular hero of song and story, and a revolutionary leader
in Armenia for the past thirty years. During the Great War, he
organized Armenian troops and led them against the Turks. Knowing the
topography of the country so well, his troops were always in the
advance parties of the Russians with whom they were
fighting<span class="corr" id="xd21e1863" title=
"Not in source">.</span> Andranick was commissioned Major-General by
the Russians and was six times decorated by them for gallantry. He
rescued and cared for thousands of Armenian refugees, who clung to his
army for months for protection; though they impeded his progress, he
could not forsake <span class="corr" id="xd21e1866" title=
"Source: t em">them</span>. His career has been one of remarkable
romance and adventure. At the present time<span class="corr" id=

that he is the only person on whose head the Turks have set a
price.</p>
<p class="par footnote cont">It is interesting to know that the hero of
Archag and Aram is a real person of flesh and blood, and has recently
been here in the United States. He came as a member of the Armenian
Military Mission to plead with the American Government for help for
stricken Armenia, asking for military, financial and economic
assistance, that his people might be enabled to help themselves in the
future.</p>

<p class="par first">On half-holidays the boys were in the habit of
going to town, to shop or to visit their friends, and on a certain
Saturday, in the month of February, they had all gone off in various
groups, and the college was deserted. Garabed and Archag took advantage
of the warm spring sunshine to climb one of the hills which rise above
the city toward the south. Here, seated on a tombstone&mdash;these
hills are covered with graves&mdash;they ate their frugal luncheon of
bread and cheese and olives, and when they had finished, Garabed wiped
his oily fingers, and drew from his zouboun a book wrapped in
newspaper.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; asked Archag.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Djelaleddin!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Archag clapped his hands:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, Garabed, how splendid! How did you ever get
hold of it? I&rsquo;ve been nearly wild myself, thinking I could never
get a chance to read our great Raffi.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1899src" href="#xd21e1899" name="xd21e1899src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, the book has been forbidden by our Padishah
(sultan) on pain of imprisonment for life, and if Dr. Mills were to
know that you had read it, he would send you packing this very day. Are
you surprised? You see Dr. Mills has had to take oath before the Vali
(governor) that he will not disseminate the new ideas among us. Ali
Pasha keeps watch, and if he should ever discover that our college was
a center of liberalism he would close it the very next day. Now our
president knows that, and he is very careful.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But how did you manage to get this
Raffi?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ghevont lent it to me this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Garabed turned the pages of the old book affectionately;
its leaves were yellow and stained.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Listen to this passage, where Sarkat, returning
from the towns, finds his own village <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>in flames:
&lsquo;After a march of several hours he perceived a red light in the
distance, becoming alternately brighter and fainter; now shooting up in
writhing flames, now motionless, the stream of fire, fed by fresh fuel,
spreading farther and farther.&rsquo; And this other bit:
&lsquo;When,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;the lamb is obliged to live near
the wolf, it must try to make wolf&rsquo;s teeth of its own, that it
may not become the other&rsquo;s prey.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag listened eagerly to these words.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, Sarkat is right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t we defend ourselves? Why don&rsquo;t we make a struggle for
our independence? Look at the Serbians, the Bulgarians, the Greeks;
they have been fighting the Turks for years; Europe has been thrilled
with joy at the noble deeds of Canaris, and Kolokotronis and
Botsaris,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1919src" href="#xd21e1919" name=
"xd21e1919src">2</a> and at last sent effective aid to the Hellenes.
Let us do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But our people are ignorant, and stagnating in
servitude; few of them know the use of arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then they must be taught, and supplied with
arms.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Who will do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We, the young men, who have the strength and the
faith for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, my dear friend! I knew you would say
that!&rdquo; and Garabed grasped his hand warmly.... &ldquo;You are
worthy of becoming one of us. Listen: other men have had your thoughts.
They have longed to arouse our people from their lethargy, to teach
them their duty and their value, so that when the accursed Kurd shall
sound the tocsin for fresh massacres, we shall not be taken unaware as
formerly, but be ready to conquer or die. Secret societies have been
formed; revolutionary groups have been organized in our towns, and they
get recruits among all classes of society. You will find
f&eacute;da&#299; (revolutionaries) in the bazaar, in the fields, even
in the serail, and in our schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In our college? It can&rsquo;t be
possible!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"></p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fact, though, and you can understand
how cautious we have had to be, to keep from being discovered. It has
been so hard for me not to speak of it to you, my best friend, but our
chief forbade it; to-day he has given me <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>leave, and I&rsquo;m
going to ask you to join our group of f&eacute;da&#299;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;With all my heart, my dear Garabed, and as soon
as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pek-et (very well), we shall admit you this
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What time?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Wait for me at half-past eight, and we&rsquo;ll
go out together.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag was full of enthusiasm; he felt that he had
become a man, and a worker for the good of his country. He hid the book
under his zouboun, and the two friends went down the hill, and made
their way back to the college.</p>
<p class="par">During study-hour Archag looked at the clock very often;
he had equations to solve, but the work did not go on well, for all the
time he was thinking over what Garabed had said. At last he closed his
copy-book in vexation, counting on finishing his task in the morning.
It was only eight o&rsquo;clock, and he opened his English reading-book
for the sake of appearances, for Badvili Melikian had spoken to him
several times already. At <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>last the clock struck the
half-hour. The boys always had an hour for recreation before going to
bed, and most of them went to the library to read the newspapers and
the American magazines. Archag and Garabed ran downstairs to the hall
where Ghevont, president of the f&eacute;da&#299;, was waiting for
them. He was a silent, reserved boy, but very intelligent, and always
among the first in his class. He came from Brousa, had lived in Cyprus
and Jerusalem, and was considered a person of consequence by his fellow
students, because of his numerous journeys by ship and rail.</p>
<p class="par">The three boys went out of the building without saying a
word. They went toward the enclosure at the end of the campus, which
was the burial-place of missionaries who had died at Aintab, and there
they sat down on an old tombstone which had fallen over during the
winter. Garabed kept watch, while Ghevont read to Archag the demands of
the society:</p>
<p class="par">1. Political and economic liberty, based on local
autonomy and federated ties, as the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>inherent right of an
integral part of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="par">2. Liberty of conscience, of speech, of the press, and
of assembly and association.</p>
<p class="par">3. Separation of Church and State.</p>
<p class="par">4. Absolute equality of all nationalities and all
religious organizations.</p>
<p class="par">5. Inviolability of the individual, of the home, and of
correspondence.</p>
<p class="par">6. Liberty of removal (of traveling from place to
place).</p>
<p class="par">When Ghevont had finished reading, he held out a wooden
crucifix to Archag, and said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Repeat my words: I swear upon this emblem of our
religion never to betray our society; to be a faithful
f&eacute;da&#299;; to be obedient and devoted even to the point of
imprisonment and death. In the name of the Virgin, Sourp Krikor, and
Sourp Thaddeus, patrons of Ha&#299;astan (Armenia). So be it.
Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag repeated the oath in a low voice, kissed the
crucifix, and made the sign of the cross three times. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Garabed,&rdquo; said Ghevont, &ldquo;will you
admit Archag to our society? Will you guarantee his good
faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Very well then, that being so, I dedicate you,
Archag, a f&eacute;da&#299;, by this brotherly kiss.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The first duty of the f&eacute;da&#299; being to help
their compatriots, according to their means and ability, it was decided
that Archag should go to town every Saturday to conduct a class in
Armenian for illiterate adults, at the school of Sourp Ners&egrave;s.
Garabed himself was giving free instruction in English to members of
the Gregorian union.</p>
<p class="par">The three boys were stirred by their common enthusiasm.
Armenia seemed to them like a bride, very fair and very pure, to whose
service they were dedicated in knightly fashion. Gazing into the
starlit night, they saw their country transformed and their people
happy. Garabed began to sing softly the March of the Dachnaktzoutioun
(revolutionary society), and the voices of the others joined him:

<p class="par first">It was a college custom for each class to go for a
three days&rsquo; excursion, before the Easter holidays, and this year
the boys of the Sophomore class had selected the mountain of Sof, to
the northwest of Aintab, as the objective point of their trip. Monsieur
Bernier and Mihran hodja were to go with them.</p>
<p class="par">About six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, one day toward
the end of March, the masters gave the signal for the start, and the
boys sprang to their saddles. They rode horses or donkeys. These
donkeys of the East are strong, vigorous animals, with bright eyes and
glossy skin, and often rival the horses in speed.</p>
<p class="par">The sky was cloudless, the air pure, and fragrant with a
thousand odors from the plain; the fields, so bare in autumn, when
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>parched by heat and drought, had put on their
bridal array of grass and flowers. The road ran beside a stream
bordered with laurel, roses and eglantine. After a ride of three hours,
the party came to the lower foothills of the mountain. The good beasts
went on bravely, picking their way among the rough stones and fallen
d&eacute;bris, never stumbling. The vegetation was marvelous; as far as
eye could see, stretched fields of narcissus, hyacinths, tulips and
gladiolas. Monsieur Bernier kept jumping off his horse every few
moments to gather a fresh handful of flowers.</p>
<p class="par">The riders stopped near a well, to eat their luncheon;
after tethering the donkeys and horses to some plane-trees, every one
proceeded to unpack his food.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Aram, &ldquo;just look at
Soghomon!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The gluttony of the fat boy was notorious; he now had
twelve eggs spread out on his knees, the sight of which sent his
companions into fits of laughter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Are you going to hatch them, or what?&rdquo;
asked the merciless Aram. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href=
"#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I speak for the chicks,&rdquo; said Dikran.</p>
<p class="par">Soghomon turned red to the tips of his ears.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Va&#299; bana (worse luck), I&rsquo;m
hungry,&rdquo; he stammered at last, &ldquo;and I always have a good
appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Right you are, old man,&rdquo; said Aram,
&ldquo;it seems to me you&rsquo;ve been getting thin lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Nejib. &ldquo;I bet he
won&rsquo;t eat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Soghomon pettishly.
&ldquo;My father ate thirteen once.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The shouts of laughter redoubled.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I bet he will eat them,&rdquo; cried Aram.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What will you bet?&rdquo; asked Nejib.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My Iceland postage-stamps.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pek-et (all right)! I&rsquo;ll bet my romance by
Walter Scott.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Soghomon was nettled by the jesting. He ate eight eggs
easily, but the ninth had a queer taste. At the tenth his stomach
seemed to close; he stuck to it however. Orientals adore betting, and
his comrades put him on his mettle. He ate the eleventh, then the
twelfth! Nejib had lost.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Af&eacute;rim, Af&eacute;rim (Bravo)!&rdquo;
cried Aram, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>delighted, and he dragged Soghomon into a wild
dance.</p>
<p class="par">It was so hot that the company unanimously agreed to
take a siesta, and not start on their way until four o&rsquo;clock....
The muezzin was just telling the hour of sunset as our cavalcade drew
up at the village of Ibrahamli, where they were to spend the night. Dr.
Spencer had given Monsieur Bernier a letter of introduction to Mustapha
Hara, the chief man of the village. The inhabitants of Ibrahamli were
Kurds, and without the doctor&rsquo;s letter, our friends would have
found every door closed to them.</p>
<p class="par">Mustapha was a bilious-looking little man, with a nose
like an eagle&rsquo;s beak; his mouth was hidden by an enormous
mustache, which curled back over his chin. At first, he looked at his
guests rather distrustfully, but after reading the letter from Dr.
Spencer, who had cured him of typhus, his face brightened. He offered
his best room to the two masters, and had some straw spread in the
courtyard for the boys. His wife and children stood in a ring around
the party of Christians, for strangers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>are rarely seen in
this obscure village. Monsieur Bernier especially excited their
curiosity; the children felt of his clothes, and a young Kurd even went
as far as to rob him of a lock of hair, having been assured by a
sorcerer that the fair head of the &ldquo;Frangi&rdquo; (Europeans) was
an efficacious protection against the evil eye.</p>
<p class="par">Monsieur Bernier and Mihran hodja had lain down on the
floor, rolled up in the quilts which Mustapha had provided, and they
were just dropping off to sleep when a sound of scratching at the door
made them start. In an instant they were on their feet.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<span class="corr" id="xd21e2077" title=
"Source: Boujourun">Bouyourun</span> (Come in),&rdquo; said Mihran
hodja.</p>
<p class="par">It was Boghos, in great agitation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Effendis, come quick! Soghomon is very sick; he
says he is going to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; cried Monsieur Bernier.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those eggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He had, before this, had some experience of the terrible
fear of sickness by which these good people are tormented; they have
iron <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>constitutions, but at the most trifling ailment,
they imagine their last hour has come.</p>
<p class="par">In the courtyard the masters were greeted by the groans
of the sufferer. The other boys and the members of the household were
standing round him in a circle, shouting and gesticulating. Each had
some advice to give, but Monsieur Bernier went up to Soghomon and
offered him a spoonful of castor-oil.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Take this, it will make you feel
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">If the patient were afraid of sickness, he was equally
afraid of medicine.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is that horrid stuff! I can&rsquo;t take
that!&rdquo; and he pushed away the spoon in disgust.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Soghomon, if you don&rsquo;t drink this, nothing
can save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">These words had the desired effect, and the sick boy
swallowed the oil, making a thousand wry faces.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right to-morrow,&rdquo; said
Monsieur Bernier, as he went back to his room.</p>
<p class="par">In the morning, the party set out for the ascent of Sof,
leaving their horses with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href=
"#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>Ibrahamli, and Soghomon, who
preferred to remain behind.</p>
<p class="par">The mountain of Sof is shaped like a tooth. The ascent
was very difficult, over a rough trail, scaling walls of rock, and
often passing close to the edge of a precipice, but on reaching the
summit the climbers were rewarded for their exertions by a magnificent
view. At their feet lay a vast plain enclosed by the hills which
separate Aintab from Killis; toward the north towered the great wall of
Anti-Taurus. Most of the boys lay down on the grass, to dry the
perspiration that streamed from their faces. A few of the more
adventurous went off to investigate the huge blocks of granite jutting
out over the depths below.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Be very careful,&rdquo; called Mihran hodja, as
he stretched himself out beside Monsieur Bernier.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Does our Sof remind you of your Swiss
mountains?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not exactly; our Alps are higher and more
majestic, but we seldom enjoy such pure air and
sunshine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was interrupted by a terrible cry, followed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>by the sound of something falling.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There has been an accident!&rdquo; said he to his
companion, and they both ran toward the rocks. There they found Dikran,
Aram, and three other boys, all pale and trembling.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Mihran
hodja.</p>
<p class="par">In reply, Dikran beckoned to them to come nearer, and
pointed straight down. There was his cousin, suspended over the chasm,
and clinging to a small tree. The boys gave a cry of horror.</p>
<p class="par">Poor Nejib had slipped as he was gathering anemones, and
had fallen between two walls of rock. His fall had been broken by a
narrow ledge covered with thick grass; a few meters lower, he had
caught hold of a young pine, but the frail tree might give way at any
moment, and then the unfortunate boy must roll down to the turbulent
stream below. With neither rope nor ladder, it seemed impossible to
save him; yet he could not be left to perish like that. There was
perplexity on every face.</p>
<p class="par">At last Archag went up to Monsieur Bernier and said:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He must have been hurt as he fell; I hear him
groaning. I am going to try to get down to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You will certainly be killed in the
attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to mountains, and I can scramble
over the rocks like a wild goat. Let us make a rope of our
girdles;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2139src" href="#xd21e2139" name=
"xd21e2139src">1</a> you fasten it about me and let me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">It was the only chance of saving Nejib, and after a
moment&rsquo;s consultation the two masters consented. They bound the
improvised rope about Archag&rsquo;s loins, and let him down.</p>
<p class="par">Our friend made good use of his hands and feet, and
finally reached Nejib. He braced himself against a rock, gripping it
with his right hand, while with the left he untied the rope and
fastened it about Nejib. The lad had sprained his ankle, and his arm
was badly bruised. Archag gave a whistle, and the rope began to go
slowly up with its burden. The spectators held their breath in
suspense: if a single girdle were to break, Nejib would be lost.</p>
<p class="par">The rope ascended; one more last pull, and<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>&mdash;Nejib was saved! The shock and pain had
exhausted his strength, and he fell fainting on the grass. Mihran hodja
hastened to take off the rope; he examined it carefully and then threw
it down to Archag, who in a few moments gave the signal, and again the
boys began pulling. Three-quarters of the ascent had been accomplished,
when the rope began to split.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Destowe, destowe (take care)!&rdquo; all the boys
cried out together, and Archag had just time to save himself by
clinging to a projecting angle of rock. He discarded the rope, now
useless, and set himself to climb up the narrow cleft in the cliff that
rose sheer before him. By dint of fitting his feet to the rough surface
of the rock, and gripping where he might with his hands, he managed to
reach the top, but not without many a bruise.</p>
<p class="par">His companions received him in their arms, and gave him
a regular ovation. Nejib had come out of his swoon, and as he looked at
Archag, his eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Avf-edersin (forgive me),&rdquo; he said, under
his breath. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Forgive you for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For pushing you that day when you were looking at
Professor Missirian&rsquo;s collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Was it you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes. Thanks to your blundering, I was punished
for reading &lsquo;The Arabian Nights.&rsquo; I thought you did it on
purpose, out of spite&mdash;Stay still; I know now that wasn&rsquo;t
true,&rdquo; (Archag had started to go away) &ldquo;I was furious, and
I was bound I would pay you back. But I haven&rsquo;t had a
moment&rsquo;s peace since. You are so good, so generous; do say you
forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag held out his hand in silence, and Nejib clasped
it with both his own. Masters and pupils alike watched this scene with
astonishment.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nejib, I can&rsquo;t say I congratulate you on
your behavior,&rdquo; cried Monsieur Bernier. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have believed it of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nor I, nor I,&rdquo; murmured the others.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; said Mihran hodja.
&ldquo;Reproaches do no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boys broke off some pine boughs and made a litter
for Nejib, but the descent was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145"
href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>very difficult, for the boy
was suffering severely, and every jolt drew from him a groan of
pain.</p>
<p class="par">At Ibrahamli, the village sorcerer massaged his foot,
and dressed his wounds according to all the rules of the profession.
The next morning he was put on a horse, and the whole company set out
on the return trip to Aintab. The president and professors were
indignant when they learned of Nejib&rsquo;s ill-conduct. Dr. Mills
imposed a punishment of three days on bounds, and made him ask pardon
of Archag publicly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h2 class="main">AN EXPULSION FROM COLLEGE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">After the excursion to Sof, Archag became the hero
of the college. The boys tried in kind ways to make him forget how
unfriendly they had been to him, and, naturally enough, vented their
ill-humor upon Nejib. But Archag and Garabed took his part; they made
him join in their walks and games, and the other boys, seeing the
attitude of these two toward the one who had wronged them, gradually
withdrew the ban of ostracism which they had laid upon him.</p>
<p class="par">As for Aram, he was beginning to tire of his Urfali, and
was only too glad to resume his friendship with Archag.</p>
<p class="par">Archag and Garabed had taken their duties as
&ldquo;f&eacute;da&#299;&rdquo; very seriously, and were trying to win
converts to the new ideas, and now Nejib <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>and Aram seemed to
them the best fitted to join the &ldquo;Dachnaktzoutioun&rdquo;
(revolutionary federation). It must be acknowledged that Aram had
changed very much of late; though he still loved to laugh and joke, he
also took an interest in the serious conversations of his friends.
They, of course, exercised extreme caution; they talked to Nejib and
Aram about the misfortunes of Armenia, then they lent them copies of
the &ldquo;Droshak&rdquo; (Standard), &ldquo;Pro-Armenia,&rdquo; and
other newspapers which gave descriptions, terrible but true, of the
condition of Christians in Turkey; and, at last, one evening, they had
the happiness of admitting their two friends into their Society.</p>
<p class="par">They also won an unexpected recruit in the person of
Monsieur Bernier. The young teacher often felt lonely among all the
Americans so much older than he, and had become especially attached to
Ghevont, Archag and Garabed. In their company he learned to love and to
pity Armenia, and got rid of certain false conceptions about it; for he
saw, instead of the Nihilists who had been portrayed to him, generous
men struggling not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148"
name="pb148">148</a>]</span>only for their liberty, but for their very
existence. He came to understand the tribulations of the Armenians, and
to feel a warm sympathy for them.</p>
<p class="par">The young students understood his feeling for them, and
used to lend him their newspapers, or translate for him passages from
the romances of Raffi and Baronian,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2202src"
href="#xd21e2202" name="xd21e2202src">1</a> thus introducing him to the
literature of their country. Monsieur Bernier offered to give them
private lessons in German, and they were with him constantly.</p>
<p class="par">Dr. Mills suspected the presence of
&ldquo;f&eacute;da&#299;&rdquo; in the college, and was especially
mistrustful of Ghevont and some of the other Juniors; but he could not
bring accusation against them without proofs, and, so far, he had been
unable to procure any. The boys were usually very cautious, but one bit
of carelessness nearly brought disaster to their Society. While playing
football one afternoon, Aram dropped a &ldquo;Droshak&rdquo; which he
was carrying hidden under his zouboun. He did not notice its loss until
after supper, and then he ran immediately to the campus, but his paper
had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>disappeared. It was a serious matter, for if the
&ldquo;Droshak&rdquo; were taken to Dr. Mills, the f&eacute;da&#299;
would be in great danger.</p>
<p class="par">Aram went up to the schoolroom, and taking Archag aside,
whispered in his ear what had happened, and Ghevont and Garabed were
soon made acquainted with the story. Ghevont turned pale; he had
received a packet of patriotic songs the evening before, and had not
yet been able to convey them to the central committee in town. The
others, too, had some compromising literature in their trunks, some of
Raffi&rsquo;s novels, and the rules of their Society. For a moment they
looked at one another in great perplexity.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; said Archag at last, under his
breath. &ldquo;Let us take all these books to Monsieur Bernier, and ask
him to take care of them for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Aram breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine idea! Do you think he will
consent?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We can try, anyway,&rdquo; said Garabed.</p>
<p class="par">The four boys went up to their dormitory on tiptoe. They
hastily tossed to one side <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>their articles of clothing, and
pulled out books and newspapers helter-skelter, covering them over with
a cloth. The most important publications they hid under their zoubouns,
which made them look like some sort of grotesque creatures with strange
humps and deformities on back and chest.</p>
<p class="par">Monsieur Bernier gazed at them in astonishment, as they
entered his room.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p class="par">Ghevont explained the situation briefly, and asked if he
would be willing to take care of their books until all danger was
past.</p>
<p class="par">Monsieur Bernier consented without hesitation; he was
heartily glad to render this service to his young friends, and they
appreciated his kindness.</p>
<p class="par">The next morning before the boys had finished dressing,
the president entered the Sophomores&rsquo; dormitory.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Open your trunks,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;some of
you are in possession of books forbidden by the government, and it is
necessary for me to find out which boys are guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boys obeyed, trembling. Aram and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>Archag exchanged significant glances behind the
president&rsquo;s back; they were congratulating themselves on their
foresight in taking the books to Monsieur Bernier at once, for if they
had waited till morning, it would have been all over with them.</p>
<p class="par">Needless to say, the search proved fruitless. Dr. Mills
made a thorough investigation in all the dormitories, but the only
contraband article he could find was a pot of jam which Soghomon was
keeping concealed under a pile of socks. He then went back to his
house. The evening before, Soghomon had brought him the
&ldquo;Droshak&rdquo; which had been found on the campus, and he
suspected Ghevont of being the guilty person.</p>
<p class="par">A few days later, he called a meeting of the faculty to
obtain a vote on the question of the expulsion of Ghevont and several
other members of the Junior class. Professor Pagratian opposed the
measure, but in vain; in the inmost recesses of their hearts the other
masters revolted against the idea of sending away intelligent and
studious boys whose only fault had been a loyal love of their country
and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>little imprudence, quite excusable at their age;
but they dared not say so.</p>
<p class="par">To repeat: centuries of tyranny and oppression have
rendered the Armenians timorous and distrustful to an extreme degree;
in Europe, this lack of courage has often given them a reputation for
cowardice which they do not really deserve.</p>
<p class="par">The boys suspected nothing; they had been working hard
for their final examinations at the close of the college year. Our
friends had all done very well; Ghevont stood second among the Juniors,
Garabed was at the head of his class, Dikran second, Archag third,
Nejib fourth and Aram fifth. Soghomon was lowest, with five marks which
had been given him as a favor.</p>
<p class="par">On Commencement Day, Professor Piralian preached the
baccalaureate sermon, and Mrs. Mills presented the diplomas and the
prizes. Then the president went into the pulpit to make a farewell
address to the students, and to wish them a pleasant vacation.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; said he in closing, &ldquo;that
you will return in the autumn with fresh vigor, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>ready to take up your work with renewed energy
and purpose. The members of the faculty regret the necessity of
informing Ghevont, Bedros, Avedis, Hamparzoum (Ascension), Panos and
Jakoub, all of the Junior class, and Levon of the Sophomore class, that
the college cannot receive them next year.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And that was all!</p>
<p class="par">President Mills came down from the pulpit in the midst
of a deathlike silence, the precursor of a tempest. As soon as the
professors had withdrawn, an indescribable uproar arose; the Juniors
gesticulating and shouting that if their classmates were to be sent
away so unjustly, they would all leave too; the other f&eacute;da&#299;
giving the signal for revolt by climbing on the benches and waving
their handkerchiefs for flags.</p>
<p class="par">That afternoon, Ghevont, Bedros and Avedis went to the
president to ask for an explanation. Dr. Mills received them with a
pleasant smile. Yes, he said, he had always been quite satisfied with
their diligence, and counted them among his best students. But
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>he could not keep them; he had good reasons for
this, which he should not tell them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But Dr. Mills,&rdquo; said Ghevont, &ldquo;do you
not know that no other college will receive us? We shall be accused of
misconduct, and this stigma of bad character will follow us all through
our student life.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; replied the president,
&ldquo;I will give each of you a certificate of good
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He sat down at his desk, and quickly wrote a few lines;
then he gave to each boy an excellent testimonial. The boys were so
astonished that they did not know what to say. Dr. Mills had to help
them out with a gentle push, after shaking hands once more.

<h2 class="main">THE HOLIDAYS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The holidays were at hand. The boys were so
absorbed in their preparations for departure and their farewell visits
to town, that the affair of the Juniors&rsquo; expulsion was to some
extent forgotten. Each morning small groups of students left the
college, to attach themselves to some caravan of merchants. They
scattered to the four points of the compass; some journeyed toward the
high table-lands of Asia Minor, others set out for the Euphrates or the
Tigris, in order to go down stream on rafts as far as Mosul or Bagdad.
As they separated, they made great protestations of friendship, which
were speedily forgotten in the happiness of returning home.</p>
<p class="par">Dikran and Nejib were among the first to leave, their
home being at Aleppo, a city <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>easily reached from Aintab. Next,
came the turn of Garabed, Soghomon and Samou&#299;l. The Juniors who
had been expelled went to Syria, for the president of the American
college at Beyrout, a man of broad views, had promised to admit them at
the next term.</p>
<p class="par">The college emptied rapidly; the dormitories acquired a
mournful atmosphere, and the voices of chance speakers re-echoed in the
deserted corridors. Archag and Aram still lingered, impatiently chafing
at the delay. As a violent epidemic of typhus was raging at Diarbekir,
Aram&rsquo;s parents thought it more prudent for their son not to come
home. This was a hard blow for the poor boy, and he was broken-hearted
at the idea of having to spend the holidays all alone at Aintab, but at
the last moment Archag invited his friend to go home with him to Van.
Needless to say, the proposal was joyfully accepted.</p>
<p class="par">After a week&rsquo;s delay, the boys succeeded in making
arrangements for their journey; they were the last to go, and Badvili
Melikian was the only person left to wish them a good journey. The
merchants in whose company they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157"
href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>were to travel were going to
Tabriz to buy Persian silks to be sold again at Damascus and Beyrout.
They were pressed for time, and made long stages, so that the journey
from Aintab to Van occupied only sixteen days.</p>
<p class="par">Soon the country began to look familiar to Archag; he
recognized villages where he had been with his father to buy horses or
sheep, and at one place an old man who was a friend of Boghos Effendi
stopped him for a chat; his was the first familiar face.</p>
<p class="par">Dear reader, have you ever spent a long year at
boarding-school? If so, you will understand Archag&rsquo;s joy at
seeing his native town again. A landscape of marvelous beauty lay
spread before his enchanted eyes. At his feet the great lake of
brilliant blue was sparkling in the sunshine, and in its transparent
waters was reflected the sublime peak of Subhan Dagh. The town with its
mighty rock crowned by the castle, and its fortified walls and towers,
lay embowered in orchards and gardens. To the right, a snow-crowned
peak dominated a natural amphitheater, in which rose the walls of the
Armenian Convent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158"
name="pb158">158</a>]</span>of Jedi Klissia (the Seven Churches). To
the west of the lake were the Nimrona Dagh and the high table-lands
which nourish the sources of the great rivers of Mesopotamia. The hills
in the foreground were carpeted with gay flowers, and were the pasture
ground for sheep and cattle.</p>
<p class="par">The horses, urged on by the spur, broke into a gallop,
and soon passed the city gates.</p>
<p class="par">May I be allowed a short digression concerning Van?</p>
<p class="par">According to the history of Armenia, the city was
founded by Semiramis, who gave it the name of Shamiram Yerd. Here, in
the charming gardens which she had planted and irrigated by means of a
thousand canals, the Assyrian queen was accustomed to seek refuge from
the intolerable heat of the Mesopotamian summer; returning to her
palaces at Nineveh at the approach of winter. The first city, having
fallen in ruins, was rebuilt, it is said, by an Armenian king whose
name was Van, shortly before the invasion of Alexander the Great. It
was sacked by Tamerlane,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2301src" href=
"#xd21e2301" name="xd21e2301src">1</a> and again rebuilt by the
Armenians. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The two boys bade a friendly farewell to their traveling
companions, in front of the khan of Achmet Pasha, and went on their
way. Before long, Archag caught sight of his father&rsquo;s house at a
turn of the road.</p>
<p class="par">Levon was keeping watch on the roof, and as soon as he
saw the travelers he hurried down and ran to meet them. Boghos Effendi
and his wife, together with all the servants, followed him out of the
house. Archag sprang from the saddle, and embraced his father and
mother and Levon.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How tall he has grown!&rdquo; exclaimed Hanna
badgi with a motherly pride in her son&rsquo;s fine bearing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Look at his pretty mustache!&rdquo; said Levon.
Everybody laughed, for Archag&rsquo;s mustache consisted of a scant
score of downy hairs.</p>
<p class="par">Then Archag presented Aram to his parents; Boghos
Effendi bade the boy welcome, and inquired for his father and an uncle
with whom he had once had some business dealings. Meanwhile Levon plied
Archag with questions about the college.</p>
<p class="par">When they went into the house, the travelers
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>found a regular collation awaiting them,
prepared by old Gulenia; tea, three kinds of jam, caghk&eacute;s, still
hot, with grapes and watermelon. They felt a keen appreciation of the
comfort and happiness of being at home. They talked gayly about their
college life, their teachers and comrades. In spite of Archag&rsquo;s
protestations, Aram insisted on telling the story of the butterflies
and Nejib&rsquo;s rescue. The father and mother had heard no word of
this, and Hanna badgi shed tears as she learned of the danger into
which her boy had run, and gave thanks to God for having so
miraculously preserved him.</p>
<p class="par">The voice of the Bakshi (watchman) crying ten
o&rsquo;clock reminded Boghos Effendi that the boys must be very tired,
so he went with them to their room, which had formerly been
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2322" title=
"Source: Nizom&rsquo;s">Nizam&rsquo;s</span>, and made them good night.
Hanna badgi lay awake a long time that night, unable to sleep for the
joy of seeing her son again.</p>
<p class="par">Aram and Archag spent the next day with Nizam and her
husband, and also paid a short visit to the old Bishop who had always
been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>especially fond of Archag. They made numerous
plans for all sorts of jaunts and excursions, and even talked of making
the ascent of Subhan Dagh; but Boghos Effendi forbade that.</p>
<p class="par">The days and hours of the holidays passed all too
quickly for our lads. Aram was eager to see everything, and Archag took
pleasure in showing his favorite haunts to his friend. About a week
after their arrival they made a trip to Akhtamar, an island in Lake
Van, where there is a celebrated monastery, formerly the residence of
three Gregorian patriarchs. When the Catholicos of Echmiadzin became
Primate of the Church, the office of his two associates was abolished,
but the convent still continues to be a famous object of pilgrimage;
its library contains many precious manuscripts in old Armenian. It is a
charming spot, with magnificent stretches of garden and lawn, and
ancient trees offering repose beneath their venerable branches.</p>
<p class="par">An old sailor was commissioned to take the boys over in
his boat, and Archag held the tiller, while Aram lay stretched out on a
seat, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>and sang at the top of his voice, or chaffed the
boatman, whom he called &ldquo;Captain of the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Superior of the monastery, a distant cousin of
Boghos Effendi, gave the lads a cordial reception and directed a lay
brother to show them all the treasures of the place: the relics of the
Saints, the old pictures, the golden censer, and the manuscripts and
objects of early art in the library.</p>
<p class="par">Then Archag and Aram went off to eat a picnic lunch on
the banks of a stream. The Superior had given them permission to take
their dessert from the trees in the garden, so our two friends filled
pockets and stomachs with plums and peaches. When they had satisfied
their appetite, they explored the whole island; Archag, conscientious
as usual, hunted for some coleoptera which he had promised to take back
to Professor Pagratian.</p>
<p class="par">About four o&rsquo;clock, however, they had to think
about going home. They found the boatman sitting in front of the
convent with some of the monks, and when he saw the boys he stood up at
once. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=

<p class="par">&ldquo;Well, Ibrahim ammi (uncle),&rdquo; said
<span class="corr" id="xd21e2351" title=
"Source: Archang">Archag</span>, &ldquo;are you ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ewet, my young Effendi, bouyourun (Yes, yes, let
us be off).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I really think,&rdquo; said one of the monks,
pointing to a little cloud over Subhan Dagh, &ldquo;that you will do
well not to linger too long. We may get a squall.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The old sailor looked up at the cloud, which he had not
noticed before.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes, yes, we must make haste; Lake Van
isn&rsquo;t pleasant in a storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A storm!&rdquo; cried Aram laughing. &ldquo;You
see everything on the dark side to-day, uncle. The lake is as smooth as
glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But Ibrahim was already untying his boat, so our friends
bade the monks good-by, and followed him.</p>
<p class="par">The island of Akhtamar soon lay a good distance behind
them; Ibrahim rowed in silence, scanning the horizon from time to time.
Aram laughed and joked; Archag was pre-occupied, for he knew the
treacherous character of the lake. Great clouds, too, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>were
coming over the mountains, and the boat rocked lightly on the
waves.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Perhaps we should do better to go back,&rdquo;
said the old man after a while. &ldquo;In an hour we should be safe at
Akhtamar, and it will take at least two hours and a half to reach
Van.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the boys opposed this wise suggestion. The family at
home would be anxious if they did not come back, and there was no storm
yet. Besides, if the situation should grow worse, they could at any
time put in to one of the villages along the shore, not more than two
miles away.</p>
<p class="par">The old man bowed his head, muttering some words of
resignation. He and Aram now bent to the oars. An hour passed thus.
They were nearing the shore, and Archag was hoping yet to make port
safely, when a flash of lightning rent the clouds, followed by the
rumbling of thunder. The old man crossed himself: &ldquo;We are in for
it now!&rdquo; he said. He lowered the sails, and prepared for a
struggle against the elements now let loose. The wind was blowing a
gale; huge waves <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>broke against the boat, drenching the three
occupants with spray, and the little vessel rolled and pitched. Aram
was no longer joking; everything seemed to turn upside down, and his
stomach was very uneasy. The poor lad had never been off the solid
earth before, and soon became very sea-sick.</p>
<p class="par">The sky was on fire; peals of thunder reverberated from
the cliffs, and rain fell in torrents. Instead of keeping on toward
Van, Ibrahim had put about and was making with all speed for the
nearest land. Calm and resolute, he preserved his sailor&rsquo;s
coolness. The boys made the best of a bad business, but now they
realized the danger that threatened them, and repented of their
rashness.</p>
<p class="par">The tempest increased in fury, and the boat seemed one
moment on the point of being engulfed in the deep, the next of being
tossed up to the sky. They were near land, but the increasing darkness
prevented them from seeing the reefs which line these shores. Suddenly
a black mass rose before them, and the boat trembled under the force of
a terrible blow. At the same time it was lifted up by <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>a
tremendous wave and dashed against the rocks. Before they knew what was
happening, all three were thrown into the water.</p>
<p class="par">Instinctively, Archag caught hold of Aram, and held him
under his left arm. He ducked to let a great wave pass over them, then,
taking advantage of a momentary calm, he swam around the reef, holding
fast his precious burden. Presently his feet touched bottom, and he
laid Aram on the ground, in a swoon.</p>
<p class="par">The night was so dark that he could not make out where
he was. Bending over his friend, Archag first made sure that he was not
seriously injured, and that the blood on his face came from nothing but
scratches; then from the gourd that he had with him, he forced a few
drops of rum between the closed lips of the unconscious boy. He had not
long to wait for the desired effect; Aram opened his eyes in
astonishment, wondering where he could be.</p>
<p class="par">The boys&rsquo; haven proved to be a deep cave in the
rocks. Archag gathered some dried water-weeds which lay strewn on the
sand, and made a great heap of them; he had no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>matches, but was not hindered by such a trifle
as that. He looked about and found two flint pebbles which he rubbed
one against the others to make the sparks fly. Before long a brisk fire
was burning, and the shipwrecked travelers dried their drenched
garments. They were not uneasy about Ibrahim, for they supposed that he
must have found shelter somewhere, and that they should find him in the
morning. Archag went down to the beach and called repeatedly, but his
voice was drowned in the tempest, and he went back to his companion.
Then they took off their clothes, which had become soaked through
again, and stretched themselves out on a thick bed of dried weeds. Worn
out as they were, with fatigue and excitement, they soon fell into a
deep sleep.</p>
<p class="par">When they awoke, the bright sunlight was streaming into
the cave, and their clothes were thoroughly dried, so they dressed and
went outside. There was not a trace of the storm; the sky was azure,
and there was scarcely a ripple on the lake.</p>
<p class="par">Our two friends were rejoiced to find that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>they
were not on a desert island, as they had feared, but on a promontory
jutting out into the lake. The cliff against which their boat had been
wrecked formed the point; on three sides it rose perpendicularly, but
was slightly inclined on the fourth, making a little cove, and here the
boys had come ashore.</p>
<p class="par">As they stood watching the lake, their attention was
attracted by a dark object which was being washed by the waves against
the rocks. On looking more closely, they thought it resembled a human
body, and both were seized by the same apprehension: could it be poor
Ibrahim?</p>
<p class="par">In a flash Archag stripped off his clothes and swam out
toward the object. Alas! it was no longer possible to doubt; it was the
old sailor. His feet protruded from the water, and his open zouboun was
floating on the waves. Archag took him in his arms and swam back to the
beach where Aram was anxiously waiting. Here, he laid the body down on
the sand. The poor man must have been hurled against the rocks, for his
face was disfigured by a bad wound on the temple. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>The
boys stood looking at him, dumb with terror.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all our fault,&rdquo; said Aram after
a while. &ldquo;He wanted to go back, and we wouldn&rsquo;t let
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Archag, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t
know the lake, and ought to have listened to him; but you mustn&rsquo;t
take his death so much to heart, Aram dear; since his hour had struck,
nothing could save him.&rdquo; But Aram, on his knees beside the
ill-fated fisherman, was sobbing convulsively.</p>
<p class="par">They carried Ibrahim to the cave and recited the prayers
for the dead. Then they decided to go to the nearest village and send
back some men to bury the body. It took them a good hour to reach the
hamlet of Bos-Ujuk, but there they found hospitality at the house of an
old servant of Boghos Effendi, Toros Ammi by name. After eating they
felt better, and asked for horses, for they were still about fifteen
kilometers from Van, but before leaving Archag begged his host to have
Ibrahim buried, promising that his father <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>would reimburse him
for the expense. The old sailor had been alone in the world.</p>
<p class="par">Boghos Effendi and his household were in a torment of
anxiety. Hanna badgi had cried all night, trembling every time a
violent gust of wind shook the house. Her husband tried to console her
with the assurance that the boys must have spent the night at the
convent, and would be at home before long, but he scarcely believed his
own words, knowing how venturesome Archag was. The poor woman shook her
head without reply. Gulenia and Krikor, kneeling before the picture of
Sourp Krikor Lousavoritch (Saint Gregory the Illuminator), muttered
prayers for sailors in distress.</p>
<p class="par">Early in the morning Boghos Effendi went to town, hoping
to find out something, but he had only bad news to bring home. It was
reported that several boats had capsized in the storm of the previous
night, and the people at the bazaar were talking of nothing else. About
ten o&rsquo;clock he went to town again, and met one of the Akhtamar
monks, who had come over to make some purchases. This <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>man
said that the boys had spent the day at the island, but had left late
in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="par">Boghos Effendi stood rooted to the ground; the
monk&rsquo;s words had destroyed his last hope, and he knew that, but
for a miracle, the luckless three must be mourned as dead.</p>
<p class="par">When he reached home he had not the courage to tell his
wife these sad tidings. Dinner-time came, but Hanna badgi refused all
food. She had lighted two tall candles before the picture of her patron
saint, believing in her simple faith that he alone could save her
child. Bowed to the ground, she continued to pray fervently, and at
last she seemed to feel that she had been heard, for she rose to her
feet, radiant.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;They are coming, they are coming!&rdquo; she
cried.</p>
<p class="par">All bent to listen: yes, they could hear the gallop of
horses at a distance. The sound came nearer, increasing in intensity,
then ceased abruptly, and the next moment Archag and Aram burst into
the room.</p>
<p class="par">They were received with cries and exclamations of joy.
Hanna badgi was too much <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>overcome to speak, and Archag had
to tell the story of their adventure immediately. Holding his
mother&rsquo;s hand, he gave a full account of their return trip,
accusing himself, with Aram, of having caused the death of Ibrahim, by
their rashness.</p>
<p class="par">Boghos Effendi had known the old sailor well; he had had
many a chat with him on the shore of the lake, and was much distressed
by the tale of his death.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are almost grown men,&rdquo; said he sternly,
&ldquo;but you act like children. If you had listened to the poor old
man, we should not be lamenting his death now. You are well punished,
and I hope this accident will teach you a lesson.&rdquo; The two boys
hung their heads in silence, for they knew that this reproof was well
deserved.</p>
<p class="par">They did justice to their dinner, after which Gulenia
ordered them off to bed. In vain they protested that they were feeling
perfectly well; the old woman would not listen to a word, and they had
to obey, half in jest, half in vexation. Gulenia had been a servant in
the family of Hanna badgi, and upon the marriage <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>of
her young mistress, had gone with her to her new home. She had a heart
of gold hidden beneath her sullen countenance, and always retained a
partiality for Archag, whom she had once nursed through diphtheria.
Hanna badgi, who was often ill, intrusted her with all the household
care.</p>
<p class="par">When the boys were in bed, the old woman brought them
two bowls of steaming broth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Drink this, my lambs,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
to-morrow you will be better than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pouah!&rdquo; said Aram, &ldquo;your tea
isn&rsquo;t as sweet as your name<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2447src"
href="#xd21e2447" name="xd21e2447src">2</a> (Rose). What is this horrid
stuff you are giving us?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hold your tongue, and drink it while it&rsquo;s
hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Aram followed Archag&rsquo;s example, and emptied his
cup, and the old woman, after tucking them up as if they were little
children, went off with an injured air. A few minutes later our two
friends were snoring in concert. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Archag was none the worse for his enforced bath,
but Aram had a bronchial cold which kept him in bed for a week. He was
coddled and cared for by the entire household; Levon brought him
sweets, Archag read to him, and Gulenia, who had constituted herself
head nurse, poured down his throat concoctions which tasted abominably.
Aram dared not resist, but he took his revenge by ridiculing her narrow
ideas, for like many aged persons, she unfortunately found something to
criticise in all modern ways.</p>
<p class="par">As soon as Aram was able to be up, the two friends
resumed their long rides about the country, and one morning they set
out to thank Toros Ammi for his hospitality, and to take him a present
of coffee and sugar, with a box <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177"
href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>of lokums (Turkish
sweetmeats) for his children. After paying their visit, they rode out a
little way on the Bitlis road, to give Aram the pleasure of the fine
view from a certain hilltop. They had dismounted, and were sitting for
a moment under a mulberry tree, when all at once they were startled by
the sound of hurried footsteps, and looking around, they saw a man
clothed in rags running toward them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Save me!&rdquo; he cried, as he came up panting.
&ldquo;In the Name of God, save me! The zaptiehs are after me; they
will be here in twenty minutes at latest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The man was still young; he could not have been more
than twenty-five or six; his face was pale, his cheeks hollow, as if
from recent illness, and partly covered by his black whiskers; his
clothes were hanging in tatters, and his feet were bandaged with
blood-stained rags. Yet he did not give the impression of a mendicant,
but of a leader, accustomed to command; his thin lips, his brilliant
eyes told of an energy which death alone could conquer.</p>
<p class="par">After a moment&rsquo;s reflection, Archag said:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>&ldquo;I know a capital hiding-place, and we can
get there in two hours, for we have fast horses. Get up and ride behind
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">No sooner said than done. The horses, spurred on by
their riders, flew over the ground, and Archag led the way over
cross-roads, to avoid any awkward encounters. The cave where he and
Aram had found shelter on the night of the storm seemed to him a safe
asylum, for the entrance was concealed by high rocks, and the place was
known only to a few fishermen.</p>
<p class="par">Before entering the village of Bos-Ujuk, Archag let his
companion dismount, bidding him wait while he and Aram went to leave
their horses with an acquaintance. They soon returned with their arms
full of provisions.</p>
<p class="par">Toros Ammi had served fifteen years in the household of
Boghos Effendi; he was a discreet person, and loyally devoted to his
former master, so Archag took him aside and told him all about his
meeting with the fugitive. Toros approved the lad&rsquo;s decision, and
thought the cave a good hiding-place; he gave the two boys a basketful
of supplies on the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179"
name="pb179">179</a>]</span>spot, and promised to take some food to the
refugee every evening, an offer which was gratefully accepted by
Archag.</p>
<p class="par">When the man saw his companions coming back, he went to
meet them.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, how kind you are!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You
are bringing me something to eat. This morning I managed to find a few
berries, but I have eaten nothing else since last evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He fell upon the bread and olives which Aram offered
him, and ate greedily. It was growing dark, and they made their way
over the rocks with extreme caution. At last, after a thousand
difficulties, they reached the cavern, a spot which awakened many
recollections in the boys&rsquo; minds. Aram and Archag took out the
treasures from their basket: dolmas,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2489src" href="#xd21e2489" name="xd21e2489src">1</a> eggs,
cucumbers and figs, and the fugitive ate ravenously, his eyes eager
with appetite.</p>
<p class="par">When his hunger was appeased, the boys begged him to
tell them his story. They were sitting cross-legged at the entrance to
the cave, with the full moon shining on them, and jackals yelping in
the distance. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I am a native of Moosh,&rdquo; said the man,
&ldquo;that unfortunate city, continually exposed to the attacks of
wandering Kurds. My name is Rupen, and I was for three years the
inseparable companion of Andranick; perhaps you may have heard of
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Heard of Andranick and Rupen, the heroes of the ballads
they so often sang? What a question! Their guest rose high in their
estimation, and they looked at him with deep respect and
admiration.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We are twice and thrice happy to know you,&rdquo;
said Archag, &ldquo;and we shall always remember this day as long as we
live. We have wept with joy when we have heard the songs of your
exploits and Andranick&rsquo;s, for,&rdquo; he added, with simple
pride, &ldquo;we are partisans of the good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What, you boys are f&eacute;da&#299;? Then I am
saved!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We shall do everything we can, so that you may
be! But do tell us how you came to join Andranick&rsquo;s
band.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Willingly,&rdquo; replied Rupen. &ldquo;My father
was a merchant well-esteemed by his fellow-citizens; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name="pb181">181</a>]</span>his
business was prosperous, and we had a very comfortable home. There was
no happier hearth than ours, but alas, misfortune lay waiting for us! I
had an only sister, two years younger than I, and celebrated for her
beauty. My father in his foresight, never allowed her to go out
unveiled; but one evening, as she was taking the air on our roof, she
was obliged to uncover her face because of the suffocating heat. She
walked about slowly, without a suspicion that there was a man at the
corner of the street, watching her carefully. It was Ibrahim Khan, one
of the most powerful chiefs of Kurdistan.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A few days later, he came, accompanied by his
attendants, to ask the hand of my sister, and was refused. The Kurd was
furious, and began to insult my father, who, driven to desperation,
struck Ibrahim in the face. Then there was a fight between our men and
Ibrahim&rsquo;s. The Kurds were repulsed; but they returned in a body,
and burned and pillaged our house. My father was killed, my sister
carried off by the bandits; my mother was overwhelmed by these events,
and survived <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>her husband only a few months. Thus I found
myself at the age of twenty alone in the world, and deprived of all;
but one thing remained to me: vengeance. I fled to the mountains, and
begged aid and asylum from Andranick. Together we made a desperate
struggle. When the hero left us for Bulgaria, I was chosen captain of
the band. During all these five years I have had but a single wish: to
kill Ibrahim Khan. At last, one month ago, I succeeded in gratifying my
desire for vengeance. We drew the Kurd into ambush, but a bullet was
too good for that miserable wretch; we hung him like a dog, and his
black soul fled to hell. Three hundred Kurds pursued us, to avenge the
death of their chief. They annihilated my band, and I am the sole
survivor of our forty companions. A price was set on my head, and for
weeks, I have been wandering in the mountains, making my way toward
Van, and hoping to get from there to Tabriz. The zaptiehs have been on
my scent since morning, when I met you my my strength was spent; an old
wound in my leg had re-opened, giving me great pain. But <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>for
your generous help, I should now be in the hands of my
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The two boys listened to this tale with eager sympathy.
It was the same old story of murder and rapine, painful indeed to the
heart of an Armenian. They assured Rupen of the concern they felt in
his misfortunes, and promised to come back often to see him.</p>
<p class="par">The next day Archag told his father about the fugitive,
and Boghos Effendi approved his son&rsquo;s conduct. Without being a
f&eacute;da&#299;, he had already been won to the new ideas, and was
impatiently awaiting an era of liberty and progress.</p>
<p class="par">To avoid suspicion, the boys went to see their friend
only twice a week. The zaptiehs were searching for him at Van, and as
long as they were there, caution was necessary. Rupen had a violent
attack of fever, and his wound, aggravated by the pursuit and the heat,
caused him great suffering. For several days he was delirious, and
turned and tossed on his couch without recognizing any one. Toros Ammi
never left his side (being a fisherman he could easily account for his
absence); <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>night and day he made and applied compresses of
plants gathered in the mountains, and at last the fever yielded, and
Rupen was once more able to recognize his friends. After this, his
convalescence was very rapid, and at the end of three weeks his health
was quite restored.</p>
<p class="par">Aram and Archag took keen delight in their visits to the
fugitive; they never wearied of hearing details about Moosh and
Andranick and his band. Rupen, for his part, had become attached to his
rescuers, and his heart was heavy at the thought of the coming
separation. But the zaptiehs had been gone from Van two weeks; moreover
he would not be really safe until he had crossed the frontier, for some
chance was liable at any time to lead to the discovery of his
hiding-place. Our boys realized this, and fixed the date of departure
themselves. They procured a complete disguise for Rupen, that of an old
merchant with white hair and a long beard, in which it was impossible
to recognize him. Boghos Effendi filled the purse of the poor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>exile, that he might not lack the necessaries of
life.</p>
<p class="par">The three friends parted with tears in their eyes, not
knowing if they would ever meet again. If all went well, Rupen would be
able to reach Tabriz in three weeks, and he promised to write at
once.</p>
<p class="par">After his departure, the days seemed long to Aram and
Archag, and they were glad when the end of the vacation drew near. No
letter came from Rupen, so they had to leave for Aintab without news of
their friend. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=

<h2 class="main">THE DEATH OF SAMOU&#298;L</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The courtyard of the college was all astir with
life: the students were arriving in small groups, and there was a
constant succession of salutations and embraces, for Orientals are more
demonstrative than northern people. Among the new Juniors, we find our
friends of last year: the two cousins, Nejib and Dikran, Boghos and his
inseparable companion Soghomon, fatter than ever; Aram, Archag and
Garabed, who had traveled together from Moosh; and lastly Sumpad and
Samou&#299;l. The latter was not at all well; he had taken cold during
the holidays, and since then had been growing very weak; his cheeks
were sometimes burning with fever, again ashen pale. His uncle had been
alarmed by his cough, and unwilling to let him go away, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>but
Samou&#299;l had begged so hard to be allowed to return to his beloved
college, that he had been allowed to come.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh! What <i>is</i> the matter with you?&rdquo;
asked Archag, as he came upon him in the midst of a fit of
coughing.</p>
<p class="par">Samou&#299;l could not reply for a moment; then he
said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this cough that hangs on so, and
I&rsquo;m so tired all the time, I can hardly move.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The good air of Aintab will make you feel better,
and we&rsquo;ll all look after you. Take my arm to go upstairs, and
lean hard on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On rejoining their classmates they heard an unexpected
piece of news: Professor Hagopian had sent in his resignation, desiring
to take a few years&rsquo; rest. His place was filled by Mr. Hairemian,
who thus became proctor of the Junior class.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The first recitation was scarcely over when the boys
poured into the hall to see if the postman had come. The mail was
brought to Aintab only on Fridays, and professors and students,
Armenians and Americans, awaited <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188"
href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>this great day with equal
impatience. Twenty times during the day the boys would run to the
porter and ask:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Posta geldin&eacute;? (Has the mail
come?)&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yok, yok, Effendis.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But this time it really had come. A cry rang through all
the buildings:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Posta gelmid&eacute;! Posta gelmid&eacute;! (The
mail has come!)&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Boys, big and little, came running downstairs. Badvili
Melikian opened the bag and distributed the letters scattered over the
table, with a word for each:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Nejib, here&rsquo;s a letter from your father in
Heidelberg. Is he going to stay much longer in Germany?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Garabed, the letter from your parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Monsieur Bernier, a letter from Switzerland, and
a parcel of newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Professor Piralian, three letters from your
friends in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Boghos, a letter from your father. Please give
him my greetings when you write.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Three more letters for Monsieur Bernier. Is it
your birthday, or what?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"
href="#pb189" name="pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Soghomon, the &lsquo;Avedaper.&rsquo; Please lend
it to me after you have read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Samou&#299;l, there is nothing for you this
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aram, two letters from Diarbekir.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Archag, one letter from Van, and one
from&mdash;what, Tabriz? I didn&rsquo;t <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2594" title="Source: nkow">know</span> you had acquaintances in
Adgemistam?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag was blushing with pleasure, for he guessed at
once from whom the letter came. He stammered out that one of his
friends had been in Persia for the last few months; then, making a sign
to Aram to follow, he went out of the room and upstairs to the
dormitory. The two boys sat down on a trunk and Archag opened the
precious letter, and lowering his voice, read as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first salute">&ldquo;Sir&eacute;li paragamner, (My dear
friends)</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What must you think of me? It is five weeks
yesterday since I left Van, and it is only to-day that I am able to
keep my promise and tell you that, thanks to the mercy of Astwatz (God,
in Armenian), I have arrived at Tabriz; but it was not without
difficulty, and my adventures have been little less than miraculous.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But let me not anticipate. When you left me, and
I saw you disappearing all too quickly from the shore of Lake Van, I
stopped for a moment, to follow in thought those faithful friends whom
I shall probably never see again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I used to walk at night, avoiding the highways
for fear of some misadventure; at daybreak I would lie down at the foot
of a pine tree, in the shadow of a rock, no matter where, provided the
place was deserted. A fortnight passed in this way; I had accomplished
more than half of my journey, and everything led me to hope that I
should reach the end without hindrance. Alas! it must needs be
otherwise. My provisions were now gone; the country was barren, there
was no fruit, not even wild strawberries or whortleberries. One day,
toward nightfall, I ventured to knock at the door of a solitary house.
I was well received, and my host, an old Kurd, gave me a bountiful
supper, to which I did full justice. I speak Turkish fluently, so it
was easy to pass myself off for a Mussulman merchant on my way to
Tabriz, and I said that I had been attacked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>by
thieves who had made off with my horse and my baggage.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;May the will of Allah be done!&rsquo; said
my host. &lsquo;He will repay you fourfold for what he has taken from
you. But a curse on these brigands who rob the servants of the Prophet,
instead of contenting themselves with Christian dogs!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;While he was talking, one of his grandchildren, a
little boy of four, had climbed on my knee and was playing with my
watch; suddenly he took hold of my beard and pulled it with all his
might, and the string that held the false hair broke, leaving the beard
in his hands, to his great terror. I saw my host&rsquo;s eyes grow big
with fright.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;so you are not
the old merchant Abdallah, as you pretended.&rsquo; He rose, and by a
quick movement pulled off my turban and white wig.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;You are doubtless a spy, one of those
f&eacute;da&#299; that infest our country. A curse on you!&rsquo; and
he spat on the ground, as a sign of scorn. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Seeking safety in flight, I rushed to the door;
it was locked. I tried to force it open, but my host had already
thundered out his orders:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Hola, Jousif, Raschid, Hamid! Seize this
dog!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In an instant I was thrown to the ground, and
bound fast; then my tormentors took me to an underground room and
double-locked the door. I was convinced that my last hour had struck,
and resigned myself to my fate, but as the days slipped by I began to
wonder, from curiosity, rather than fear, what they were going to do
with me. Every evening the door of my prison was opened, and a hand
passed me a jug of water and some bread. The continued suspense began
to weigh upon me. Five days had now passed since the catastrophe. I was
lying in a troubled sleep, when a slight sound made me wake up with a
start.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo;<a id="xd21e2629"
name="xd21e2629"></a> I cried.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stir,&rsquo; replied a voice,
&lsquo;it is a friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;A friend? Then I have not been
forgotten?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193"
name="pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;No; I am an Armenian like yourself, and
all the sons of Ha&#299;k are brothers. Everything is ready for our
flight; there is not a moment to lose. Come.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We went out of the cellar, and I breathed in the
pure night air with delight. The watch dog gave a threatening growl
when he saw us, but as soon as he recognized my companion he became
quiet and wagged his tail with joy. Two horses were waiting for us,
with a pistol attached to each saddle. We mounted them and soon
disappeared in the night. I waved my arms for joy; I was free; fortune
was smiling on me again.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;As we galloped along over a by-way, my companion
told me his story. His name was Puzant, and he was the son of Armenian
farming people. When he was twelve years old, the Kurds plundered his
village, his parents were killed, and he himself was taken prisoner and
sold as a slave. The same old story, so common in Armenia.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My host had bought him, and converted him to the
Mussulman faith, giving him the name of Hamid. The child became a
youth; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>he was diligent, and apparently submissive and
attached to his master, but he had not forgotten; he steadfastly
cherished the purpose of fulfilling the oath of revenge which he had
taken before his dying father.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When my disguise was discovered, he made a vow to
set me free and at the same time to regain his own liberty. Fate had
favored him, for Rhasoul Khan, instead of cutting my throat
immediately, had sent one of his men to fetch zaptiehs from the
neighboring town. This delay had given Puzant time to get everything in
readiness for our flight. First he put poison in the Kurd&rsquo;s rhaki
(liquor) and that of his men; then he saddled the horses, took arms and
ammunition, and finally opened the door of my prison. The zaptiehs
could not reach the farm before morning; we had Rhasoul Khan&rsquo;s
best horses, and at least <span class="corr" id="xd21e2648" title=
"Source: hix">six</span> hours&rsquo; start.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;For three days all went well. We were nearing the
end of our journey, without having met with any hindrances; only a few
miles more lay between us and the frontier, which we planned to cross
during the night. When <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>the full moon was up, we set out,
and made our way very cautiously across a marsh, leading our horses by
the bridles, and attentive to the slightest sound. The hoot of a
screech-owl startled us, and as we stopped, in momentary hesitation,
the sound of a pistol-shot rang out, and a bullet went whistling over
Puzant&rsquo;s head. We could hesitate no longer; we were discovered,
so we left our good horses, regretfully, and took to our heels, rushing
madly forward. It was a wild chase. In the darkness we had many a slip
and fall, and our hands and faces were torn by thorns. Our enemies were
in hot pursuit, and shooting at random, guided by the sound of our
voices. Our strength was spent: then, at last, we heard the sound of
rushing water; it was the stream that separates the two countries. We
sprang forward and leaped into the surging waters&mdash;we set foot on
the other side! As a response to our shout of joy, came a howl of rage
and five pistol-shots. I felt a sharp pain in my shoulder: the bullet
had entered the flesh, but I nerved myself to bear the pain, for
liberty was opening her arms to me. We <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb196" href="#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>soon disappeared
behind the rocks; we were saved, for our enemies would not dare follow
us on Persian territory.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What more shall I tell you? We had come to the
end of our adventures, and the rest of the journey was child&rsquo;s
play. After resting a few days in the village, where the hodja dressed
my wound and applied a healing balm, we resumed our journey to Tabriz,
no longer on foot, but by carriage, and in broad daylight.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have found again the generous friends of whom I
spoke to you: Doctor Harontounian and the Vartabet (priest) Gerdulian.
They got work for Puzant with an Armenian weaver. As for me, the hour
has again struck for my departure, and I leave by automobile for
Djoulfa to-morrow; there, I shall take the train for Tiflis, where I
expect to stay several weeks. Then I shall go to Bulgaria to rejoin
Andranick. I take leave of you, my friends: thank you again and again,
and, if God so pleases, may we meet again.</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;Yours devotedly,</p>
<p class="par signed">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Rupen</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Shall we ever see that brave fellow again?&rdquo;
said Archag.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; replied Aram. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
run away to Europe and join him,&rdquo; he whispered in his
friend&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p class="par">The dormitory was now full of boys, and it was necessary
to guard their speech. Archag put the letter back in his pocket, and
went over to the window, where he began to chat with Samou&#299;l.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; he
asked, observing his friend&rsquo;s pallor.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; stammered Samou&#299;l;
but his speech was checked by a rush of blood. The handkerchief which
he had put to his lips was stained crimson. There was a murmur of pity
from the boys, and they made haste to carry the sick lad to his bed:
Archag kneeling beside him, bathed his temples, while Garabed ran for
Dr. Spencer.</p>
<p class="par">The doctor&rsquo;s face grew grave as he examined
Samou&#299;l, and listened to his breathing.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He must be taken to the hospital,&rdquo; said he
to Badvili Melikian; &ldquo;he will get better care there than
here.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The change was made at once. Samou&#299;l was not
suffering, but his life was ebbing away. Badvili Melikian told the boys
that their comrade was going to die, and they were moved and saddened
by his words. The Juniors took turns in going to spend their spare
hours with the sick boy, taking him gifts of flowers and fruit.
Samou&#299;l never complained, but always welcomed his friends with a
smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he said once to Garabed,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to live much longer. I am so glad; I have no
one left on earth, and I&rsquo;m so tired all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For a few days he felt a little better, and was able to
get up and walk about in the hospital garden; then he had another
hemorrhage, more violent than the last.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It is the end,&rdquo; said Dr. Spencer. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think he will live through the night.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boy was drowsy all day, but about five o&rsquo;clock
he opened his eyes and smiled, as he saw Archag sitting by his bed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You all spoil me,&rdquo; he said to his friend,
as he smelt the flowers he offered. &ldquo;When I am <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>down
there&rdquo; (and he pointed to the hospital cemetery), &ldquo;you will
cover my grave with cyclamen, won&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s my favorite
flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh Samou&#299;l! You&rsquo;re not going to leave
us! What shall we do without you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Without <i>me</i>?&rdquo; repeated the sick boy
in surprise. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose there was any one who would
miss <i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Hush, hush! We all loved you&rdquo; (Archag was
already using the past tense, unconsciously). &ldquo;Whenever we had a
favor to ask, whenever we had no time to do our work and were afraid of
being punished, to whom did we turn? To you, always to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Samou&#299;l listened, happily.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is it true, is it really true, what you are
telling me?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I swear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m very happy, for I&rsquo;ve been of
some use in the world, and there will be somebody to mourn for me when
I&rsquo;m not here any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The two boys were silent for a moment. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=
"pb200">200</a>]</span>Archag was too much moved to speak. Samou&#299;l
seemed very weary; he looked at his comrade in silence, and after a
little while he said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for you. Up there. I so hope you
will all come and join me. You will do your best to, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;And when you want to do something wrong, just
think that it hurts me, and perhaps that will help you resist the
temptation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag bent his head in assent. Never before had he seen
death so near, and he was completely overcome.</p>
<p class="par">The sun had disappeared behind the hills that outline
the horizon; the sky had faded from brilliant red to pale yellow.
Samou&#299;l slept for a few moments, then he opened his eyes again and
said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I have just seen the new Jerusalem, the city with
streets of gold. Angels were holding out their arms to me, and I saw my
mother among them; I don&rsquo;t remember her face, for she died when I
was only three years old, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203"
href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>I knew her at the first
glance. It&rsquo;s strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">His voice was altered, and in his great black eyes was
reflected the mystery of the Beyond. Then he was seized with a choking
fit, and Archag held a glass of lemonade to his lips. He drank a few
drops, and thanked his friend with a smile.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;How beautiful my mother is! And she looked at me
so lovingly!
But&mdash;she&mdash;is&mdash;here&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He could not go on; his features contracted in a spasm
of pain, then they resumed their expression of peace and happiness.</p>
<p class="par">Archag, terrified, sprang to the bell.</p>
<p class="par">The nurse came running in.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is he worse?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I think&mdash;he has
fainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The nurse gave one look at the bed, and divined the
truth.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; she whispered, kissing the
marble brow.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Good-by, my darling boy; God has taken you to His
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag was convulsed with tears, as he knelt at the foot
of the bed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The boys planted cyclamen on Samou&#299;l&rsquo;s grave,
as he had wished, and in the spring, when the fields are full of
flowers, it is covered with a wonderful carpet of pink and white.

<h2 class="main">THE STUDENTS PRESENT A TRAGEDY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Great news: the students were to act a tragedy
during the Christmas holidays. The winter was very severe this year,
and the proceeds of the play were to be distributed among the poor.</p>
<p class="par">Mr. Piralian selected the Christian tragedy of Santourt,
by Thomas Terzian. Every one approved the choice, but when the poor
professor came to assign the parts, he found himself in an embarrassing
situation. For the boys, with unbounded confidence in their aptitude
for high tragedy, all wanted to play the leading r&ocirc;les, and
refused to take any others, as being beneath their dignity. The college
was all topsy-turvy; Dr. Mills had to threaten to forbid the
performance altogether before these embryo actors could be pacified.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href="#pb206" name=
"pb206">206</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The president then commissioned Mihran hodja Kurkjian,
professor of Armenian, to assign the parts. This measure met with
approval, for the boys were very fond of Mihran hodja. The part of
Santourt, the martyr-princess, was given to Garabed, because of his
pretty face and rather feminine features. Aram and one of the Freshmen
were to be his attendants. Archag was to play Yervant, the
fianc&eacute; of the fair Santourt; Nejib the old king, Sanadroug;
Soghomon, the future pastor, was chosen to represent Saint Thaddeus,
the Missionary Apostle of Armenia. So they were all satisfied, and set
themselves in good earnest to study their parts. All the talk was now
about tragedies, famous actors, costumes and acting. The boys called
one another by the names of the heroes they were to impersonate, and
some of them embellished their conversation with lines from the
tragedy.</p>
<p class="par">When the dinner-bell was heard, Dikran, who had the part
of the king&rsquo;s cup-bearer, would say to his comrades:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come, noble sons of Ha&#299;k, to assist at the
feast of the gods. The table groans beneath <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>the
weight of succulent viands, and the fair-haired Aphrodite will pour us
out ambrosia.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The others, quite carried away by his poetic ardor,
would reply with the chorus of the third act:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Glory be to Aphrodite, the Queen of Cyprus! The
whole world acknowledges her power; the flowers bloom in her honor, and
the birds sing her praises&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; then, O sad return to
mundane matters, they would fall to eating their bread, their olives
and their cucumbers, and would drink ambrosia&mdash;in the form of
clear, cold water!</p>
<p class="par">Soghomon, in the process of learning the part of Saint
Thaddeus, had become convinced that though he was not yet the Apostle
of Armenia, he should be some day. Already he beheld the Gregorian
Church revolutionized by his mighty words, and the people won by his
preaching. He scanned his lines; he labored to make his pronunciation
more impressive by dragging out the last syllables, and raised his arms
as if in the act of blessing a thousand heads bowed at his feet, to the
great amusement of his companions. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208"
href="#pb208" name="pb208">208</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">In the course of a Turkish lesson, in which Saint
Thaddeus II had been conspicuous for his stupidity, Professor Hairemian
became exasperated, and sent him to his seat.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Go and sit down, Soghomon; you will stay in for
an hour and learn this lesson over again for to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The culprit hung his head and murmured, just loud enough
to be heard: &ldquo;Scorned by men, I will take refuge on the barren
mountain tops; the birds will provide me with sustenance, and my soul
will sing acts of thanks-giving.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The whole class broke out into a great shout of
laughter, and the professor, dumbfounded, asked:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Come now! Are you making game of me, or have you
really gone mad?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;These words of the Saint, expressing my feelings,
seemed to me to be adapted to the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; cried the exasperated
professor, &ldquo;I do believe this play-acting has deprived you of the
small portion of brains you had left! Take care, or we shall have to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>send you to Asfourieh&rdquo; (the lunatic asylum
near Beyrout, the only one in Asiatic Turkey).</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The rehearsals proceeded very well, and at last the day
of the first performance had come and the great dining-hall had been
transformed into a theater. An hour before the rising of the curtain
the room was nearly filled with relatives and friends of the students;
the first three rows of seats reserved for the Americans and their
families, were the only ones unoccupied. None of these good people had
ever attended an entertainment like this. They talked and laughed, and
called to one another from one end of the hall to another, eating
oranges and cracking nuts. At a quarter before seven, the president and
his wife, Dr. and Mrs. Spencer, Miss Wylie and the other missionaries
entered the hall.</p>
<p class="par">Presently the curtain rose before the astonished eyes of
the spectators. The stage was decorated with flowers and foliage
plants, and draped at the back with the Turkish and American
colors.</p>
<p class="par">The old king, Sanadroug, wearing a gold-paper
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>crown on his white head, is conversing with his
prime minister. He confides to him his anxiety about his daughter: the
beautiful Santourt is no longer her old self; she is grave and serious,
she affects black garments, and shuns the dances and games of her
companions. The monarch&rsquo;s speech is interrupted by the entrance
of a slave, the bearer of mournful tidings. Santourt, stirred up by the
Apostle Thaddeus, has broken the statue of Aphrodite. The messenger is
interrupted by the sound of a great tumult; the young girl is being led
before the king by a company of pagan priests. A murmur of admiration
greets the virgin martyr; with her long black tresses, her white robe,
her eyes shining with the inspiration of faith, she is ravishingly
fair, and no one could have had a suspicion that it was Garabed the
Junior, under this disguise.</p>
<p class="par">The second act is supposed to take place in
Santourt&rsquo;s prison; the decorations were not changed, but the
audience was not disturbed by that. The princess has to listen to the
entreaties of her father, and scarcely has she rejected these, when her
lover presents himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>before her. Yervant falls on his
knees, and weeping, entreats Santourt to renounce her error. He pleads
their love; but it is in the name of that very love that Santourt
remains deaf to all entreaties; she, in her turn, seeks to win Yervant
to the Christian faith. The hero resists and leaves her in despair.
Nothing can save Santourt now, and she is condemned to death.</p>
<p class="par">In the third act we see her going to the altar,
accompanied by her women, who have also become Christians. Fortified by
Saint Thaddeus, whom she has been able to see once more, she advances
with firm step, singing the praises of the true God. Her martyr&rsquo;s
death reveals the truth to Yervant, who becomes a Christian on the
field of battle. Since the death of his fianc&eacute;e, life has no
more charms for him, and he resolves to anticipate death. The Persians
advance in great numbers, meeting the Armenians with furious
resistance. Their young prince is ever in the thick of the fray. In
spite of his wounds, he fights like a hero; his blood flows; he grows
weak; a final <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>blow overcomes him, and he expires breathing the
name of Santourt.</p>
<p class="par">Archag put all his own patriotic feeling into his
acting; the constraint of the first few moments vanished, and the
college and his companions seemed far away. He was no longer Archag the
Junior, but Yervant the Armenian hero, and was suffering with him. The
audience hung on his lips, most of them sobbing like children; when the
prince fell dead, the hall was absolutely silent.</p>
<p class="par">The Armenians were living over again that glorious past;
they had quite forgotten where they were. At length the president
clapped his hands, and at once a tumult of applause broke forth. The
women waved their handkerchiefs, the children cried, &ldquo;Viva
Yervant, Viva Yervant!&rdquo; and Archag bowed his thanks, with a heart
full of gratitude, for he realized that the enthusiasm was for Yervant,
that glorious hero of centuries long past, the embodiment of the
strength and power of the ancient Armenian people.</p>
<p class="par">And now, Sanadroug, overwhelmed by the death of these
two victims, could not resign <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213"
href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>himself to live without his
cherished daughter, and plunged his poniard into his own heart. As he
was taking leave of his people in some magnificent lines, Sumpad, an
Assyrian slave, burst out laughing, thus creating some confusion on the
stage, and in the hall as well, but one of his friends dragged him off
behind the scenes, and no great harm resulted from the occurrence.</p>
<p class="par">The curtain had fallen for the last time, but the
audience still kept their seats, calling vociferously for Santourt,
Yervant and Sanadroug. They went away only when the porter came to
request it, and for many a day afterward, they talked of nothing but
the theatrical entertainment at the college.</p>
<p class="par">The boys gave four more performances of
&ldquo;Santourt,&rdquo; and won the same success each time. The
proceeds were gratifying, and it was with legitimate pride that Archag
and Garabed took to Dr. Mills the goodly sum of one hundred and thirty
Turkish pounds, for the poor of the city. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In spite of the fact that Dr. Mills had sent away
the leaders among the f&eacute;da&#299;, the society still continued to
exist, the only difference being that its members exercised more
caution than formerly. Archag had been chosen president; he called no
more meetings, for fear of being discovered, but he had long
conversations with Garabed, Aram and Nejib about the problems of their
country. The four boys were always together. Nejib had now a great
admiration for Archag, and invited him to spend the Easter holidays at
his home in Aleppo.</p>
<p class="par">Nejib&rsquo;s father, Dr. Rossinian, was the leading
physician of Aleppo. While his numerous colleagues barely managed to
secure a living, he made money hand over fist. He lived in a
magnificent house, and kept an automobile, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>a
carriage, and saddle horses. All this luxury he owed to his wife, an
Irish lady abounding in energy and good spirits, who had been for
several years head nurse at the Aintab Hospital, at the time when Dr.
Rossinian, fresh from the University of Beyrout, was there as resident
physician. The Irish lady had fallen in love with the young man, and he
had made her an offer of marriage. When she became his wife, she gave
him all her savings, in order that he might continue his studies, and
went with him to Europe. After spending four years at German and
English universities, Dr. Rossinian established himself in Aleppo,
where by means of his skillful operations and remarkable cures, he
acquired an extensive practice among the wealthy classes of the entire
province. His wife did not let him rest on his laurels, however; she
spurred him on to further study, and it was due to her persuasion that
the doctor went to Europe every three or four years, to keep abreast of
his profession. Dr. Rossinian&rsquo;s love and admiration for his wife
were unbounded, and she adored him with all the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>ardor of her early attachment. They had two
children, Nejib, and a daughter, Winifred, two years younger.</p>
<p class="par">Archag had heard of the luxury of the Rossinians, and
when he and Nejib reached their journey&rsquo;s end, and were driving
through the streets of Aleppo, he wondered with a little uneasiness,
how he would be received. The carriage stopped in front of a large,
handsome house, and the boys were ushered into the hall by a negro
servant. Then they heard footsteps, and the doctor, with his wife and
Winnie, came forward to welcome the travelers. Nejib embraced his
parents and sister and presented Archag.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Bouyourun, Baron Archag,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Rossinian; &ldquo;welcome to you!&rdquo; and she shook hands with him,
English fashion.</p>
<p class="par">Her very face, in its frame of soft gray hair, breathed
kindness; she was dressed in black silk, and Archag observed that her
fingers were loaded with rings. Winnie was a pretty young girl of
fifteen, with mischievous eyes; she made Archag feel extremely shy.</p>
<p class="par">The dinner hour had been set forward in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>honor of the two boys, who declared they were as
hungry as wolves. When they entered the dining-room they found only
Winnie and her governess there. Miss Pritchard was a long and lean
individual, all angles and asperities. She must have seen rather more
than forty summers, but nothing in the world could ever make her admit
it. She was one of those daughters of Albion who, though living in
various parts of the world, still retain their own habits and English
peculiarities. Miss Pritchard, for instance, would have thought herself
forever disgraced if she had appeared a single evening without dressing
for dinner; no matter if she happened to be traveling in Asia Minor, or
sitting down to a cup of tea with bread and butter, she would make no
exception to her rule. She always withdrew to her room an hour before
the meal, to emerge clad in a silk dress, with a bright ribbon in her
hair. For her, there was but one country in the world: England. In
spite of the comfort and luxury which she enjoyed, she was always
lamenting her &ldquo;English home.&rdquo; At the bottom of her heart,
however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>she very well knew that she was much better off
at Aleppo than in England, where she would have had to work hard to
earn her living. It need hardly be said that after living ten years in
this country, she did not know ten words of Turkish. She had never
become accustomed to the small discomforts of the Orient; a flea gave
her a nervous shock, and other insects threw her into a swoon. These
ill-turns recurred at such frequent intervals that nobody was alarmed
by them any more. Some one would give her eau de cologne to inhale, and
after five or ten minutes the poor lady would come to herself, saying:
&ldquo;It is too dreadful, I must pack my trunks at once; so sorry to
leave you all, dears, but I can&rsquo;t stand it any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Nobody took her at her word, however, and by the next
day she had forgotten all about it. The Rossinians overlooked her
numerous eccentricities, for she was a very good teacher, and devoted
to her pupil.</p>
<p class="par">When Archag was presented to her, in accordance to all
the rules of good society, she held out two fingers with an indifferent
air, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>looked him over from head to foot, murmured a,
&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; and turned her back on him.</p>
<p class="par">But the doctor and his wife quickly put Archag at his
ease. They had a deep feeling of gratitude toward him, for they knew
that to him they owed the life of their only son. Mrs. Rossinian asked
him a multitude of questions about his family, to which he replied
without embarrassment. Miss Pritchard asked him if it was very hot at
Van, and without waiting for his reply, declared that she could never
get used to the heat of Aleppo.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I bear it, I bear it,&rdquo; said she
plaintively, &ldquo;but how I do miss our dear London fogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then she began to sing the praises of her native land.
She was off on her favorite hobby, and no one paid much attention to
what she said. She sat opposite Archag, who thus had a good opportunity
to study her singular coiffure, a sort of tower made up of braids of
hair, both natural and false, and adorned with puffs and rings and
curls. This structure was crowned with a large bow of ribbon, which
varied in color, according to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220"
href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>the season; the dark shade,
worn during the day, gave place to rose-color, pale green or yellow for
dinner; on Sundays it was pure white, black in Holy Week, and blue at
Christmas and Easter, as a symbol of hope.</p>
<p class="par">The lady, off at full tilt in praise of England, felt a
little uncomfortable with those two eyes fastened obstinately upon her,
and retaliated by staring back at Archag:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;why do you
stare at me like that? Do you take me for a show-window?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">And poor Archag was so disconcerted by this sally that
he did not open his mouth again during dinner.</p>
<p class="par">The next morning Nejib began taking his friend about to
see the sights of Aleppo; the bazaar, the citadel, and the Dshami
Zakarja (the Mosque of Zacarias) where is still shown the so-called
tomb of the father of St. John Baptist. Aleppo, surnamed by the Arabs
Esh-shehba (the gray city) is one of the most ancient cities of the
world, for according to the Egyptian inscriptions it was already in
existence two thousand years before the time <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>of
Christ. The prophet Ezekiel calls it Helbon (<a class="biblink xd21e68"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezek%2027:18">Chapter
xxvii, 18</a>). The Arabs gained possession in the year 634 of our era,
and gave it the name of &ldquo;Haleb.&rdquo; Under their sway the city
grew and prospered; though more than once destroyed, as it was by
Tamerlane in the year 1400, each time it has risen from its ashes.
To-day it plays an important part in commercial life, for it is from
Aleppo that the caravans set out for Kurdistan and Mesopotamia.</p>
<p class="par">I must admit that Archag took very little interest in
the ruins of the Arab tombs; he liked better to walk about the great
city and look at the show-windows of the great European shops, or to
take a ride in the automobile. Almost every evening he went to the
railway station to see the train from Beyrout come in. He felt a
childish delight in watching the powerful locomotive approach, puffing
clouds of smoke, slacken its speed, and then come to a stop close
beside the platform. He used to feel of the heavy wheels, examine the
boiler, and ask questions of the engineer. Nejib would finally have to
take him by the arm and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href=
"#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>drag him away by main force, or he
would have stayed in the station all night. With the exception of Miss
Pritchard, who continued to regard him as some sort of curious animal,
every one was very kind to him. Winnie treated him as if he were a big
brother; Archag told her stories from old Armenian legends, and the
young girl&rsquo;s happiest hours were those which she spent with the
boys. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=

<h2 class="main">ARCHAG IN SOCIETY</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Rossinians were giving a party in honor of
Winnie&rsquo;s fifteenth birthday, and for several days before the
event, Nejib and his sister endeavored to initiate Archag into the
mysteries of the dance, but their pupil did not make very good
progress; he made fun of himself, saying that he skipped with about as
much grace as a young bear. He got on well enough with the polka, the
glide, or the lancers, but as soon as the lad began to waltz, his head
swam, his feet got all mixed up, and he was obliged to stop.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite useless for you to try any
more,&rdquo; said Miss Pritchard amiably. &ldquo;I would much rather
teach a camel to dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So Archag took her at her word and gave up trying to
waltz. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">All the young people of Aleppo were invited to the
Rossinian&rsquo;s party. There were the daughters of the English
consul, there were pretty young girls of the Levant, loaded with jewels
and gewgaws, and there were dapper secretaries from the different
consulates, whose only serious purpose in life seemed to be dancing
with young girls. Archag felt embarrassed in the midst of all this fine
society; he noticed that his brown suit and blue tie attracted
attention; the young men turned to look at him, and the girls whispered
to one another and shrugged their shoulders. Nejib had offered to lend
him a dinner-jacket, but he was too proud to accept it, and now he was
sorry. Miss Pritchard, swathed in mauve silk, with a bunch of violets
poised at the top of her capillary edifice, looked him over
disdainfully. Winnie, to be sure, had said a few pleasant words to him,
but she was too much occupied with receiving her guests to give him
much time. For a while he sat by himself in a corner, looking over a
book, for the sake of appearances; then Nejib came looking for him, to
announce supper. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225"
name="pb225">225</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ghel tchabouk (hurry up), I want to present you
to Mademoiselle Mar&eacute;chal<span class="corr" id="xd21e2921" title=
"Source: .">,</span> for you have to take her in to supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag followed him, greeted the young lady with an
awkward bow, and offered her his arm. At the table he felt very much
out of his element. His companion, the daughter of a rich French
merchant, took no notice of him; she would reply dryly to the few
remarks which the boy addressed to her, and would then turn to join in
the merriment of those near her at the table.</p>
<p class="par">The young people were lingering over dessert, when the
enticing strains of a polka were heard; they rose at once, and each of
the young men invited the girl whom he had taken in to supper to be his
partner in this first dance. The couples formed gradually; Archag had
made up his mind not to dance, but when he saw himself left almost
alone with Mademoiselle Mar&eacute;chal, who was looking at him in some
embarrassment, he summoned all his courage, and asked her to be his
partner. And the polka was so easy, he need not be afraid of making a
blunder. All went well at first, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226"
href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>and Archag began to
congratulate himself on getting out of the difficulty so well. But,
alas, he had not reckoned with the parquet floors to which he was not
accustomed. He slipped, and fell full length, dragging his partner down
with him. Mademoiselle Mar&eacute;chal got up in a rage, hearing the
ill-suppressed laughter of the other dancers. Archag was crimson with
shame, as he stammered out a few words of apology, but the young beauty
cut him short:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a little too much! When one
doesn&rsquo;t know how to dance, one at least refrains from making
himself ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag longed for the earth to open and swallow him; but
that being impossible, he went off to hide himself behind a group of
foliage plants. The heat was suffocating and his head throbbed; he
thought of his own relatives, so simple in their ways, and felt how out
of place he was in this ball-room.</p>
<p class="par">His reverie was interrupted by the sound of approaching
voices. He would have liked to slip away unperceived, but it was now
too late; the newcomers were already seated on a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>divan, and Archag, hidden behind his screen of
foliage, heard everything they said.</p>
<p class="par">One of the young men was congratulating Winnie on the
success of her party, and the others added their praises. This sort of
conversation was not interesting to our friend, and his thoughts were
far away again, when he was startled by hearing his own name
spoken.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What has become of your Baron Archag?&rdquo; said
some one.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He has probably gone to hide his diminished head
in the cellar, or perhaps he is refreshing himself at the
sideboard,&rdquo; cried an Austrian.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a regular Danube peasant&rdquo;
(Archag recognized the voice of another Armenian boy), &ldquo;and I
can&rsquo;t understand Nejib&rsquo;s inviting him here. Did you hear
what a noise he made when he was drinking? Just like a dog, licking his
dish.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ashamed?&rdquo; cried Winnie.
&ldquo;If Nejib were here he would soon teach you how to behave. Do you
mean to say you have forgotten that this Danube peasant, as you call
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>him, saved Nejib&rsquo;s life? He is a fine boy,
and my father and mother love him dearly<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e2951" title="Source: ;">.</span> When I look at him I can&rsquo;t
help thinking that but for him I shouldn&rsquo;t have my brother any
more, and it&rsquo;s easy enough to forget his small defects in the way
of training.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle
Mar&eacute;chal, &ldquo;but he ought not to have asked me to dance when
he didn&rsquo;t know how, himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; retorted the Armenian boy,
&ldquo;that Monsieur is as proud as a pasha; he thinks he knows it all,
and when he goes back to Van he will probably go around boasting about
what a success he was in society. Since Nejib is under obligations to
him, he might better have given him some sort of present; the poor lad
feels entirely out of place here, and is sighing for his goats and
their stable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t true!&rdquo; cried Winnie again.
&ldquo;Baron Archag is modest and shy, but he is very happy here. Only
yesterday he was thanking mamma in such a touching way, it brought
tears to my eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Since he pleases you so much, I&rsquo;m sorry
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>he didn&rsquo;t dance with you,&rdquo; replied
Mademoiselle Mar&eacute;chal, pursing her lips.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;He must have had nerve to ask you. No doubt if he
could have executed the sword dance or some other wild man&rsquo;s
antics, he would have done himself proud; but he was a big fool to try
the polka, a dance of civilized people!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag had restrained himself until now: but this last
insult of the other Armenian boy was too much for him, and brushing
aside the foliage which had hidden him, he came forward to face his
adversary. Only his black eyes, darker than usual, and his quivering
nostrils, betrayed his emotion.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I
am no good at these complicated European dances; luckily I can still do
the sword dance that you scorn so, as our heroes used to dance it
before engaging in battle. I am going to dance it for you, but I shall
not invite Mademoiselle <span class="corr" id="xd21e2971" title=
"Source: Marc&eacute;chal">Mar&eacute;chal</span> to take part in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He went out of the room, and soon returned, bringing a
sword and a shield. Before the guests had recovered from their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>surprise, the orchestra was playing a sad and
tender melody, and Archag had begun to dance, brandishing his shield
and sword above his head. As the music grew louder and more wild, the
movements of the dancer increased in rapidity; now he darted forward,
and stood poised with uplifted sword, to repulse an imaginary enemy;
again he spun around like a top, whirling his sword rapidly, and
beating upon his shield. Then the music gradually grew soft again,
Archag&rsquo;s intensity relaxed, and at last he sank exhausted on a
seat.</p>
<p class="par">The young people were roused to enthusiasm: they
appreciated the beauty of this dance, and felt its superiority to the
modern ball-room dances, so conventional and unpoetic. They all
gathered eagerly around Archag; even Mademoiselle Mar&eacute;chal
congratulated him, and invited him to call, on her reception day. Nejib
and Winnie were delighted with their friend&rsquo;s success. As for the
other Armenian boy, he remained forgotten in a corner, quite eclipsed,
and no one noticed when he went away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">Archag&rsquo;s visit to Aleppo soon seemed like a
beautiful dream, vanished all too quickly; he was continually thinking
about the good doctor, and his wife who had been a second mother to
him, and of charming Winnie. He now felt like an older brother to
Nejib, for Mrs. Rossinian had made him promise to watch over her son,
and shield him from the bad influence of certain other boys.</p>
<p class="par">The school work went badly that year, for there had been
serious disturbances and outbreaks in the vast Ottoman Empire. Every
one could feel a storm brewing, and the Armenians were fearful of fresh
massacres. The Turks themselves declared that their government was
corrupt, and that nothing short of a revolution could regenerate their
wretched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>country. Men of culture and education, imbued
with the new ideas, had formed a secret society called &ldquo;Union and
Progress.&rdquo; They called themselves the &ldquo;Young Turks,&rdquo;
for their recruits came chiefly from among the young men of the
country. Their object was the abolition of despotism and of the reign
of terror set up by Abdul Hamid, and they demanded a Constitution and
equality of rights for all Ottomans.</p>
<p class="par">The professors of the college took a lively interest in
these questions. All their sympathy, all their devotion went out to the
Young Turks. But this unrest and excitement gave President Mills reason
to fear for the future of the college; the f&eacute;da&#299; were now
meeting openly, with the approval of the masters; never had the
examination papers been so poor, for the boys, instead of working at
their lessons, were giving their whole attention to politics.</p>
<p class="par">The morning for announcing the promotions had come, and
the boys were just finishing their breakfast when Mihran hodja came
rushing into the dining-room. He was too <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span>excited to speak at
first, but after a little he managed to utter the words:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The young Turks have risen at Constantinople!
Abdul Hamid is obliged to yield to superior force, and grants us the
Constitution. Long live the padishah!&rdquo; (sultan)</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Iashasoun padishah! Iashasoun padishah!&rdquo;
repeated the boys in chorus.</p>
<p class="par">The f&eacute;da&#299; broke out with their war song:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Fight on, ye children, bravely, ever
bravely,</p>
<p class="line">Fearless before the enemy we stand.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="par first">All the boys, together with Badvili Melikian and
Mihran hodja, joined the f&eacute;da&#299; in this song. They were
free! The reality was more beautiful than their boldest dreams had
pictured it. God had answered the prayers of the Armenians!</p>
<p class="par">Archag, Aram, Garabed and Nejib started off at once for
town. Over every house floated the red flag with the white crescent;
cannon shots were fired from the old Cathedral, and an extraordinary
excitement prevailed in the streets. The people were shouting, singing
and weeping for joy; Mullahs<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3014src" href=
"#xd21e3014" name="xd21e3014src">1</a> and Gregorian <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>priests were embracing one another. The most
ferocious of the Mussulmans had forgotten their old hatred of Christian
infidels: to-day all were brothers.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;In our empire,&rdquo; said a vartabed (Gregorian
priest) &ldquo;there will no longer be Turks, Greeks, Albanians,
Armenians, Syrians and Arabs. No, there will be only Ottomans,
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Two dervishes (Mussulman monks), delirious with joy,
bore the priest off in triumph. The Turkish women had taken off their
veils, and waved them as they sang. All Turkey was quivering with the
same generous emotion. The words &ldquo;Equality&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Fraternity&rdquo; intoxicated the men like strong wine. Alas; we
are to see how bitter was the awakening and how great the
disillusionment!</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems too good to be true,&rdquo; said
Garabed.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Archag, &ldquo;for years the
Armenians have been groaning and dying under the yoke of the Mussulman,
and now the deliverance has come suddenly, when nobody was expecting it
any more. No bloodshed, as in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235"
href="#pb235" name="pb235">235</a>]</span>the French Revolution; no
frenzied demagogues, ready to become tyrants themselves! We have
forgotten Abdul&rsquo;s crimes; now we have only to remember the favor
he is granting us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No more teskerehs (passports),&rdquo; said Aram.
&ldquo;No more forbidden books. We shall be able to go to Europe and
study, and to travel freely. Life is decidedly good!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">In the evening, the students, led by the professors, had
a torchlight procession, and went all about through the city streets.
They stopped in front of the serail (palace) where they played the
&ldquo;Hamidieh March,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3033src" href=
"#xd21e3033" name="xd21e3033src">2</a> and the Kaimakan thanked them
from his balcony, and had sherbet served to them.</p>
<p class="par">In the midst of the general rejoicing, our friends were
saddened by the thought of the approaching departure of Monsieur
Bernier. Their French master, having spent two years at Aintab, now
desired to travel and see other countries. He had accepted a position
at Constantinople as tutor to a Turkish prince, and his life in the
Ottoman capital promised to be full of interest. At the same time, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span>was very sorry to leave his dear Central Turkey
College, where he had passed such happy days.</p>
<p class="par">He was to go by araba to Alexandretta, and was planning
to go from that place to Palestine. At five o&rsquo;clock in the
morning a servant came to tell him that the carriage was ready. He had
taken leave of his American friends the evening before, but when he
went down to the courtyard, to his surprise he found nearly all the
boys waiting to bid him a last good-morning. There were tears in many
eyes as they crowded around him for one more grasp of the hand.
&ldquo;A good journey!&rdquo; they cried: &ldquo;God bless
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag and Garabed got into the carriage to go with him
as far as the first change of horses; then they, too, had to part with
Monsieur Bernier. He made them promise to write often, and if possible,
to visit him in Switzerland. For a long time he followed them with his
eyes, leaning out of the araba; and when they were lost to sight, he
sat back with a sigh, for he counted the two years at Aintab among the
happiest of his life. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span></p>

<p class="par"><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=

<p class="par">Next day began the general disbanding of the students.
They were all getting impatient to see their relatives again, and to
tell them all about the joys and sorrows of their college life. Aram
went to Diarbekir for his vacation this year, so Archag went to Van
alone, and his holidays passed very quietly. He did some studying with
his brother-in-law, for he had to begin working for his diploma. He
dreamed of pretty Winnie more than might appear to be necessary; if we
could have followed him to his room in the evening, we should
frequently have caught him scribbling away with ardor, composing
inflammatory verses in which he lauded the &ldquo;fair tresses and
violet eyes&rdquo; of his girl-friend. He never spoke of her, and his
parents did not even know of her existence, but he carried in his
coat-pocket a little snap-shot of Winnie on her horse, which he had
purloined from Nejib with the greatest difficulty.</p>
<p class="par">It was without much regret that he saw the time draw
near for his journey back to Aintab. His brother was going with him
this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>time, for Levon was now fifteen, and ready to
enter the Freshman class.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck,&rdquo; said Archag.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have anybody to pilot me around when I first went
to Aintab.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Levon, shrugging his
shoulders. &ldquo;I can get on all right by myself, you won&rsquo;t
need to bother about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">He was a very independent boy, and was delighted with
the idea of going to college. However, when his old mother put her arms
around him and cried, and his father squeezed his hand very hard, to
hide his feelings, and the time had come when he must say good-by to
the careless life of childhood, his bravado vanished, and he no longer
tried to hide the tears that filled his eyes.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Time passes swiftly: our friends are now Seniors, in
their last year at college. They have changed very little during the
last two years; they have grown tall, and seem more serious, that is
all. They have the good reputation of the college at heart, and their
importance is recognized, for Dr. Mills has entrusted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name="pb241">241</a>]</span>to
them the responsibility of seeing that the boys of the other classes
obey the rules. At recreation-hour, instead of shouting and playing and
tumbling about like young puppies, they walk up and down in small
groups, discussing every subject that comes into their heads, from the
dinner which was not to their taste, to deep problems of ethics and
philosophy. Aram alone is just the same, loving a joke as well as ever,
and never done chaffing his classmates about their solemn airs and
judicial scowls.</p>
<p class="par">The Rossinians spent the summer in Anti-Taurus, and
stayed for a fortnight at Aintab on their way back to Aleppo. Winnie
was sun-burned and brown as a little Arab. Miss Pritchard was glad to
be returning to Aleppo, preferring the comforts of home to the beauties
of nature.</p>
<p class="par">Nejib and his friends dined with the Rossinians every
evening, and Archag was in the seventh heaven on these occasions; his
greatest happiness was to be near Winnie and look at her, and it was
not very long before Aram <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href=
"#pb242" name="pb242">242</a>]</span>observed this dumb adoration, and
teased him well for it.</p>
<p class="par">One evening Winnie and our friends were talking about
Armenia, and Archag told the story of Rupen, and of the atrocities
committed at Moosh and Sassoun.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said he joyously, &ldquo;that bad
dream is over, and we have forgotten our hereditary hatred.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Winnie listened in silence; her heart beat faster
whenever Archag confided to her his plans and his desire to study
medicine and settle down at Bitlis, that desolate town where there was
not a single doctor, and where the people, mown down by epidemics, were
dying like flies, for want of intelligent care. The lad had a high
conception of his duty toward his neighbor, and Winnie thought him the
best person she had ever known. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"

<p class="par first">But, alas! the Constitution did not bring the
expected changes. The revolutionary movement had been superficial and
had won only the liberal youth and university students. After the first
months of intoxicating joy, the old hatred of the Mussulman for the
infidel awoke again, and the disheartened Christians found only enemies
where they had looked for brothers. The government did not keep any of
its promises; the best positions were held by inefficient men, who
obtained them at a high price; the &ldquo;bakshish&rdquo; (bribe)
system prevailed everywhere, as before. Employees in subordinate
positions remained unpaid; the roads and railways which the Young Turks
had proposed to build, as well as the schools which they had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244" name=
"pb244">244</a>]</span>planned to establish, existed only on paper.</p>
<p class="par">The Christians, seeing the old hatred thus springing up
afresh from its ashes, began to tremble for their life. Alas! the
reality was to exceed their worst fears.</p>
<p class="par">A religious Conference of Christians from all parts of
Asia Minor was to be held at Adana during Holy Week, and Jousif hodja
and his wife stopped at Aintab on their way to this gathering, to the
great delight of Archag and Levon. The journey from Van had been a hard
one for Nizam; she was hoping that a few days&rsquo; rest would set her
right, but when the time came to resume the journey, she was still so
weak that Dr. Spencer advised her to wait at Aintab until her husband
should return.</p>
<p class="par">The Aintabl&eacute;s (residents of Aintab) responded
eagerly to the invitation from their brethren of Adana, and a hundred
and twenty of them undertook the journey. With them went the two
Americans, Dr. Mills and Dr. Spencer, Professor Pagratian and Professor
Piralian, the pastors and elders of the three Protestant Churches, and
a few of the college <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245"
name="pb245">245</a>]</span>students; among these were Boghos Poladian,
whose parents lived at Adana, and Archag, who was allowed to go with
his brother-in-law. They all started out together, a happy company,
waving their handkerchiefs, and gayly calling &ldquo;Au revoir&rdquo;
to their friends and acquaintances. Little did the ill-fated travelers
suspect that this was the last time they should ever see their
friends.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">They had good horses and reached Adana in five days.
Archag and his brother-in-law accepted the hospitality offered by
Boghos&rsquo; father, who was Secretary of the American Mission at
Adana. He lived in a small house beside the hospital; both courtyards
were entered by the same gate.</p>
<p class="par">The Christians were conscious of a great deal of stir
and excitement among the Mussulmans, but they were not alarmed by it.
The first meeting of the Conference was held and Professor Pagratian
preached a sermon on the immortality of the soul. His words made a deep
impression on those who heard him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246"
href="#pb246" name="pb246">246</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Our friend,&rdquo; said Professor Piralian later,
&ldquo;was filled with the Spirit of God; we had never heard him speak
like that, and I am convinced that he had a presentiment that his death
was near.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On their return to the house, the Poladians and their
guests knelt to pray together, and then retired for the night. Jousif
hodja, Archag and Boghos shared one room. About two o&rsquo;clock in
the morning Archag was awakened by fearful cries. The room was bright
with the glare of flames, and he ran to the window, and saw the Mission
school on fire. There were men running through the streets, shouting:
&ldquo;Death, death to the Christians! Long live Allah!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag, in mortal terror, woke his companions and, they
dressed hastily, hoping to be able to take refuge in the American
hospital, but even now they heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs,
and the next moment a band of Kurds burst into the room. In a flash the
three young men were dragged into the courtyard, where there were
perhaps a hundred other Christians, among others the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>Poladian family and Professor Pagratian. The
Kurds heaped insults upon them and struck them in the face; then they
called upon the men to become Mussulmans, on pain of death. A few of
the younger men, mad with fright, yielded, and twisted the white turban
around their heads, but the others refused with firmness and
decision.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; commanded the chief of the Kurds.
His men obeyed, and many of the Armenians fell. Professor Pagratian and
Jousif hodja were struck in the heart, and killed instantly. Boghos was
only slightly wounded. A Kurd went up to him and commanded him to
abjure his faith.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied in a clear tone, &ldquo;I
will not deny my Saviour; kill me, if you will. I will die a
Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The savage, in his fury, dispatched him with one blow of
his axe. Noble boy! He was faithful unto death, and now he wears the
martyr&rsquo;s crown.</p>
<p class="par">The brigands, now stirred up by the sight of blood,
proceeded to commit the most unheard-of atrocities. They respected
neither <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=
"pb248">248</a>]</span>age nor sex; they tore babies from their
mothers&rsquo; arms, and dashed out their brains against a wall; they
tied children together, and after pouring petroleum on them, set them
on fire. As the poor little creatures writhed in agony, their
tormentors uttered yells of delight.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;See the monkeys of the Constitution dancing the
polka!&rdquo; cried one.</p>
<p class="par">After a complete massacre and pillage, they left the
courtyard, to give themselves over to fresh deeds of carnage
elsewhere.</p>
<p class="par">Archag had been wounded in the shoulder, and had fainted
from pain; his enemies therefore thought him dead. When he recovered
consciousness, the sun was shining full upon the scene of woe.
Carefully making his way among the bodies of the dead, he managed to
drag himself to the gate of the hospital, where he was helped in by a
nurse. A violent fever set in, and for a long time his life was in
danger.</p>
<p class="par">For three days, the Kurds kept up their hideous work;
the soldiers sent by the government to establish order, joined the
murderers, and committed crimes so abominable that the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>pen
refuses to record them. The massacres extended throughout the province;
about thirty thousand Armenians were killed, and the vali (provincial
governor), with his customary indifference, let it be done.</p>
<p class="par">Dr. Spencer was a victim to his devotion; a bullet
struck him full in the chest, while he was making strenuous efforts to
check the fire at the Mission school. He fell at his post, a true
soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="par">Several days passed before the news of the
doctor&rsquo;s death reached Aintab. As Mrs. Spencer was sitting on the
veranda at the Normal School one day, she saw Dr. Mills coming toward
the house. But where was her husband? The poor lady&rsquo;s heart was
torn with an agony of fear.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Not here, not here? Where can he be,
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">When Dr. Mills came in he grasped her hands, and said
simply:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Your husband is with the Lord: you may be proud
to be the widow of a martyr, and of one so brave and faithful. Our
friends Rodgers<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3147src" href="#xd21e3147"
name="xd21e3147src">1</a> and Pagratian have gone with him.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name=
"pb250">250</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At first Mrs. Spencer was stunned by the blow. She
withdrew to her room and fell on her knees, begging God for strength to
accept His will. But keenly as she felt her own grief, she thought of
many others who had been afflicted as severely as she, and were in need
of her help.</p>
<p class="par">When she had become quieter, she went to the
Pagratians&rsquo; home. There she found the professor&rsquo;s widow and
children, and poor Nizam, prostrated by the dreadful tidings; and their
grief was pitiful to see. When Mrs. Spencer appeared, her face
transfigured by suffering, they all felt as if an angel of the Lord had
come down among them. They prayed together for a long time, and rose
from their knees almost happy in their thought that their beloved ones
were with Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">Archag had to stay at the Adana hospital three weeks
before he was able to return to Aintab. Nejib, Aram and Garabed were
told when he was expected, and went out to meet him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Poor Archag!&rdquo; said Nejib. &ldquo;What a sad
way to come back! He went off so gayly.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Garabed. &ldquo;I can hear him
now talking with Boghos about a trip to Tarsus which they were planning
to take when they left Adana. We must try to comfort him, for Dr. Mills
told me he was very sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">But the reality exceeded their expectation, and they
could hardly repress a cry of surprise when they saw Archag. His hair
had turned entirely gray; there were dark circles around his eyes, and
his mouth was disfigured by a badly-closed wound. His friends welcomed
him with a warm grasp of the hand.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We are so happy to see you again, dear
Archag,&rdquo; said Garabed. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what anguish
we have suffered. For several days we thought you must be dead, because
the report had gone about that all the Aintabl&eacute;s had been
massacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It seems to me like coming back from the abode of
the dead, it was so frightful, and the scenes of bloodshed are before
my eyes all the time. I can&rsquo;t help thinking about it by day, and
every night I dream of it, and am perfectly exhausted when I wake
up.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The poor lad was trembling as he spoke, and had to wipe
the perspiration from his brow. Aram patted him on the shoulder.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Courage, old man! Think of your parents, and of
your sister who has lost everything; you will have to be the one to
console her.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag made no reply, and his friends, feeling
constrained by his silence, stopped talking, too. When the carriage
entered the college courtyard, it was immediately surrounded by the
students, all waiting for the traveler and eager to show their
sympathy. But Archag left them very soon, and went to the
Pagratians&rsquo; cottage. A woman dressed in black was sitting by the
door, and he ran to her and threw himself into her arms, sobbing.
Brother and sister wept together long, and after their first grief was
spent, Nizam took Archag into the house, where he told the story of
that terrible night.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;When our tormentors were about to fire,&rdquo;
said he<span class="corr" id="xd21e3178" title="Source: .">,</span>

order again: &lsquo;Fire! Fire!&rsquo; At last they fired. Even then I
could hear our dear Professor Pagratian saying, &lsquo;Jesus, Jesus, we
are coming to Thee!&rsquo; Then I fainted away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Pagratian children were sobbing: &ldquo;Papa, papa,
what shall we do without you?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;What miracle prevented your being killed like the
others?&rdquo; asked Nizam.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;It really was a miracle. My swoon only lasted a
few minutes, and when I came to myself, the Kurds were killing the
women and children. I had strength enough to drag myself a little way
and hide behind a pile of wood, then the sights all around were so
terrible that I fainted again. After a long time I regained
consciousness; it was broad daylight, and the courtyard was deserted.
You know already how they took me in at the American hospital, and took
care of me till I was healed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">THE MARTYRDOM OF THE ARMENIANS</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The college year closed in sadness. There was a
new English teacher in the place of Professor Piralian, who had been
seriously wounded at Adana and, for the time being, was unable to
conduct his classes. Professor Pagratian&rsquo;s successor, an Armenian
of Aintab, was still in America, not to return before the autumn term;
Dr. Mills took his work in the meantime.</p>
<p class="par">Archag could not forget the painful events in which he
had participated; he was no longer his old self, but always under a
cloud. He avoided the companionship of the students and spent his spare
time with his sister. Nizam was still with the Pagratians, waiting
until the college examinations were over, so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name="pb255">255</a>]</span>that
she might have her brothers&rsquo; escort on the journey home.</p>
<p class="par">Archag&rsquo;s sadness was due not only to the death of
his brother-in-law and of the other Armenians; no, there was a deeper
reason. His faith in God had been shaken, as well as his confidence in
human nature.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; he asked himself,
&ldquo;that a God of kindness, a Father who loves His children
tenderly, can permit such horrors?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; whispered the tempter in his ear,
&ldquo;the God whom you adore is hard and inflexible; in His sight men
are no more than grains of sand, and He is quite indifferent to our
fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The lad was greatly depressed by these thoughts, and
felt a growing distaste for life. Nizam and Garabed, to whom he
confided his doubts, could not succeed in consoling him.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;We must accept the will of God,&rdquo; his sister
would say, &ldquo;death ought not to be a terror, but a joy, for it
marks the beginning of our eternal life. In Paradise there will be no
more tears, no more sorrow nor parting.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But these words did not convince him, and Nizam&rsquo;s
sadness increased as she marked this change in her brother.</p>
<p class="par">One evening, as he was returning from a solitary walk,
he met Mrs. Spencer. He would have passed on, but she stopped him:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Oh, Archag! Don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry; let
us have a little chat. Why aren&rsquo;t you with your friends, instead
of wandering about the country like a lost soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I prefer to be alone; my sadness is oppressive to
my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;So instead of exercising a little self-control,
you go on brooding over your sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forget what has
happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Of course not. I quite understand that, but there
is something else troubling you; I have noticed it for a long time.
Won&rsquo;t you talk to me as you would to your mother, and tell me
what it is that is hurting you so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Archag was won by the motherly tone.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The fact is, Mrs. Spencer, I am consumed by
doubt; God seems to me so cruel, I can&rsquo;t believe in His
goodness.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257"
name="pb257">257</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Mrs. Spencer became grave. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
remember those words of the Bible, &lsquo;Whom the Lord loveth He
chasteneth,&rsquo; and &lsquo;His ways are not as our
ways&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yes; but those horrible massacres, why did He
permit them? Thousands of Armenians have perished. Look at the widows!
Look at the orphans! Look at the misery!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Why did He permit it? Because he thought this
trial necessary to our faith. Besides, did He not foretell trials and
tribulations? Think of the first Christians, submitting to torture as a
means of glorifying God, seeking death that they might draw near to
Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But what good can come of such
atrocities?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Archag, Archag, is it for us to put such
questions? I am not blaming you, for when President Mills told me of
the death of my dear husband, I reeled under the terrible blow, and I
too murmured, &lsquo;Why, O Lord, why? He was working here so earnestly
for the advancement of Thy Kingdom; why hast Thou taken him?&rsquo; But
the Lord took pity on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href=
"#pb258" name="pb258">258</a>]</span>my weakness, and showed me His
reasons. You know Ners&egrave;s, the son of Badvili Ballosian? His
parents used to be broken-hearted over his frivolity and misconduct.
But the martyrdom of his father affected him so deeply that he has
repented of his ways, and given his heart to Jesus.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Yesterday I was present at a prayer-meeting in
town. Both men and women were filled with the Spirit of God; never have
I heard such prayers; the world and their sufferings were quite
forgotten, and all those radiant faces plainly declared that they had
found the Saviour. The memory of Professor Pagratian and Dr. Spencer is
alive in their souls, and these lives of self-denial, crowned by
martyrdom, will continue to be an example for us all. Believe me,
Archag, the massacres have been a baptism of blood for the Armenians,
and have taught your people to understand themselves better. Look at
the Church: it was never stronger than at the time of the great
persecutions. If the Armenians had known nothing but prosperity and
comfort, they would not be what they are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb259" href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>to-day; the
pernicious influence of <span class="corr" id="xd21e3255" title=
"Source: Mohometanism">Mohammedanism</span> would have had its effect
on their hearts and weakened their courage. The Armenian nation would
have forgotten its glorious past and denied the religion of its
fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">As she spoke the light was kindled in Archag&rsquo;s
soul, and he realized his obduracy and want of faith. Of course he
would never forget that night of terror, but now he had learned to
accept it as the Will of God.</p>
<p class="par">It was growing dark when he got back to the college, but
his friends were struck by the change that had been wrought in him, and
were overjoyed to have their old Archag back again.</p>
<p class="par">He regained his bright faith in the Divine Goodness, and
took pleasure in the wonderful beauty of Nature. Sometimes a shade of
melancholy would cloud his face; then he seemed to hear the cries of
the children and to see again their mutilated bodies; but the clouds
were soon dissipated. He applied himself diligently to study, and had
the good fortune to stand second in the roll of graduates. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name="pb260">260</a>]</span>All
the Seniors passed their final examinations, and it was with real
regret that they left their dear college, to enter on a new phase of
life.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Ten years have passed since our friends left the College
of Aintab, and we shall give a short account of their experiences.
Alas! the most terrible of catastrophes has just befallen the Armenian
people; one half of them have been massacred by the Turks, deliberately
and in cold blood; the Euphrates and the Tigris have been choked with
dead bodies, and the victims&rsquo; bones have been collected in heaps
on the desert. Several of the characters of this tale met their deaths
during this persecution. Boghos Effendi, his wife and Levon are no
more; both Garabed, who was working in his uncle&rsquo;s mercantile
establishment at Sivas, and Soghomon, who since 1912 had been a pastor
at Aintab, suffered martyrdom. Some of our other young people have been
more fortunate; Aram, after receiving a degree in chemistry from
Harvard University, was appointed to a professorship in a college
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span>in the far west. He is the same old Aram, and
his pupils love him for his good spirits and for taking an interest in
their affairs. Dikran is in New York; Nejib studied surgery in London
and Vienna, and then returned to Aleppo as his father&rsquo;s
assistant. Archag, too, studied medicine; he took his degree at Geneva,
and retains a grateful memory of the hospitality of the Swiss country.
He refused an advantageous offer made to him from the University of
Beyrout, that he might establish himself at Bitlis. For his duty seems
to him plain: he must help his people in their wretchedness, physical
and moral. Four years ago Winnie became his wife; she is an ideal
companion, sharing his cares, and interested in all his work. A pretty
little boy, another little Levon, has been for three years the great
joy of his parents.</p>
<p class="par">At the beginning of the Great War, Nejib and Archag were
mobilized as doctors. Turkey being in urgent need of physicians, these
were spared in the general massacre, as by a miracle, so that Dr.
Rossinian is able to continue his practice at Aleppo. He met with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>a great bereavement in the death of his wife,
five years ago, but Winnie and her child have come to stay with him.
The last news from their dear ones is good: Nejib, taken prisoner by
the English, had an excellent position at Jerusalem, while Archag was
still caring for the wounded on the Caucasian front. The young wife
keeps up bravely: her faith is strong, and she knows that the Lord is
able to give her husband back to her, if it is His will. Nizam has
married again; this time to Professor Piralian, who is teaching at
Robert College. Being under American protection, they have escaped
death, but have been without news of their friends for four years. Mrs.
Mills is in America, but the president remained valiantly at his post.
He gives his services without stint; he has taken in one hundred
orphans, and his heroic conduct has won the gratitude of all Armenians.
After the massacre of masters as well as pupils, the college was
obliged to close its doors, but with the hope of re-opening them after
the war. Its work, however, will not be lost, for it has made upright
and honorable men of the boys <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263"
href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>entrusted to it, and
Christians in the real sense of the word.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">And now, after all these hours together, my dear
readers, we must part. If the story of Archag and his friends has
inspired you with an affection for a people so cruelly tried, and a
tenderness for the widows and orphans so unjustly robbed of their loved
ones, our object has been attained. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
